# Safety During Construction

Always dry fit parts before applying epoxy, and sand if necessary so that they fit properly.

When sliding circular parts together, hold them so that the epoxy forms a fillet and doesn't pool or drip off. The required orientation is usually vertical.

If you slide two parts together, the epoxy will always be pushed forward off of the part on which the epoxy was applied. e.g, if you are epoxying a coupler to the inside of a body tube, the excess epoxy will be on the inside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the inside of the body tube, and on the outside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the outside of the coupler.

Twisting circular parts while pushing them together will spread the epoxy more evenly in the joint.

There is a student-written [TLDR](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/DX3AssemblyTLDR.md.html) talking about hints when following the instruction. It was written for the MiniDX3, but it still largely applies to the other Level 1 rockets.

There is a detailed student-written [blog](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/DX3AssemblyBlog.md.html) on putting the rocket together. It was written primarily for the MiniDX3, but it still largely applies to the other Level 1 rockets.

# Construction Hints

## Aerotech Arreaux Motors
1. It’s worth buying an extra-length motor-mount tubes when attempting the level 1 certification. A length of at
   least 15" will work for Aerotech 29/180 or shorter motors. _You'll need to fiberglass your rocket
   to fly motors with more than 180 Ns of impulse_. You will need a length of at
   least 16¼" for the H115DM-14A, the H182R-14A, the H135W-14A, and the H195NT-14A, and a
   length of at least 19¾" for the I205W-14A. For the extra-length motor mount tube, you can either order
   the replacement motor mount tube  from [Aerotech](https://www.aerotechstore.com/products/product_16e318e6-c2fd-e5a5-d053-3e84f31591c7),
   or [eRockets](http://www.erockets.biz/aerotech-motor-mount-tube-29-mm-x-17-3-4-inch-12918/).
2. You won't need the 24 mm motor adaptor and don't need to construct it. Most of the parts
   are no longer in the kit.
3. You need to attach the included motor retainer instead of the Motor Hook, Thrust Ring,
   and Thrust Ring Flange. These changes are detailed in the Arreaux Motor Retainer Upgrade
   Notice. Attaching the motor retainer should be done AFTER the rest of the rocket construction
   is completed (after Step 1 of the FINAL ASSEMBLY AND FINISHING in the instructions), otherewise
   it will block the application of the cyannoacrylate to the fin roots and the aft Centering Ring.
   Use JB Weld to attach it. The details are in the Aerotech 29 mm Motor Retainer Instructions
   (all on the Aerotech website <http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/resources.aspx?id=4> near the bottom of the page).
4. Use tapped holes and threaded #6 nylon screws to secure the nosecone to the payload section.
   Two is the minimum, three is recommended, four is allowed. Friction fitting with tape isn't sufficient.
5. It's often useful to be able to replace either the body or the payload/nosecone. The recessed
   screw eye on the payload section makes it difficult. You may want to make an extension out of
   1/8" rope and a quik-link and attache the shock cord to the quik-link.
6. Make sure you can dry-fit the fins BEFORE you CA them in place. You may need to sand down
   the ridges a little to be able to snap the fins into place.

## Folding a parachute

The goals in folding a parachute are the following:

* Protect the parachute from the hot gases and ash generated when the ejection charge goes off. Plastic-film chutes can form a tangled messy wad if contacted by the hot gases and ash. Nylon chutes can end up full of holes and function improperly.
* Keep the shroud lines from tangling during deployment.
* Ensure that the parachute slides easily into and out of the body tube, so it will deploy properly.
* Ensure that the parachute canopy inflates fully after ejection.

Begin by stretching the parachute out by two opposing shroud lines to form a half circle (or half hexagon or half octagon, depending on how the chute is cut).

![The Parachute Folded in Half](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_OpenChute.jpeg)

The illustrated chute is for the Vulcanite. It has eight shroud lines. In this case we fold the two outermost lines to meet in the center with the center shroud line. For a hexagonal (six shroud line) chute like for the miniDX3, you would fold so that the shroud lines meet the opposing shroud lines to form a triangle.

![The First Two Folds](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_FirstFold.jpeg)

**If necessary** For an eight shroud line chute it's necessary to fold the chute in half again to form a triangle. For a six shroud line chute, the first two folds of the 1/2 chute should have formed a triangle and the third fold is unnecessary.

![The Third Fold](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_SecondFold.jpeg)

We are going to fold the shroud lines inside the chute to reduce the chances that they will tangle or get snagged on something during ejection. Place the shroud lined on top of the chute as shown.

![Placing the Shroud Lines in the Triangle](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_ShroudLines.jpeg)

Then fold the triangle over the lines by bringing the two sets of shroud-line attachments together to form a thin right triangle. Then fold the long tip of the triangle down to the base (where the shock cord meets the shroud lines, and fold the remaining triangle tip over to form a rectangle as shown).

![Protecting the Shroud Lines in the Chute and forming a rectangle](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_Rectangle.jpeg)

Beginning at the top of the rectangle (the side furthest from the shock cord), roll the chute tightly into a cylinder as shown.

![The Parachute Fully Rolled](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_Rolled.jpeg)

Place the chute in the center of the Chute Protector with the two parts of the shock cord going to your left, as shown.

![The Chute Placed on the Chute Protector](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_ParInCover.jpeg)

Take the lower corner of the chute protector and wrap it around and tuck it under the chute, like starting to roll a burrito, as shown.

![The Bottom of the Chute Protector Rolled around the Chute](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_FirstRoll.jpeg)

Fold the two horizontal corners of the chute protector into the middle of the chute protector, just like you were rolling a burrito. The one shock cord will pass through the hole in the chute protector, and the other one will be routed approximately as shown.

![The Sides Folded Over](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_InPocket.jpeg)

Now finish rolling up the chute inside the chute protector, like you were finishing a burrito or a spring roll. Try to ensure that none of the parachute is exposed outside of the chute protector. Any that is exposed is guaranteed to have a hole burned through it from the hot ejection gases and ash.

Again, to offer maximum protection to the chute, orient it so the end without the shock cords will enter the body tube first, and the end with the shock cords faces the nose cone or payload section.

![Preparing to Place the Chute in the Body Tube](https://dofprobucket2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Images/VUL_ByTube.jpeg)

First place all of the shock cord that is below the parachute into the body tube with as few tangles and twists as possible. Then slide the parachute into the body tube. If you've folded and rolled it correctly, it should slide into the body tube with very little effort. Slide it in as far as your finger will pushe it, and then place the remaining shock cord on top of it, and place the payload section or nose cone on top of the body tube.

While I have found the illustrated method to be completely reliable, there are alternate methods for folding a parachute.
