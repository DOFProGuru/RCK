# LOC Dual Deploy Vulcanite

[OpenRocket File](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/SimModels/DDVulcanite.ork)

| Center of Mass | 30.5 | in | From tip of nose |
| Diameter | 57.6 | mm | From specs, not measurement |

A I140W-14 motor was used for the feb-23 flight, and a J270W-14 was used for the jul-23 flight. The weather was fair. 1mph wind for the fed-23 flight. 7mph winds for the jul-23 flight. Both flights were performed with temperatures around 65°F.

A J530 motor was used for all flights with the Madcow adventurer. Both of the 17 Apr 2021 flights weathercocked a fair amount. On the same flights, the thermistors were somehow reading about 70°F. The humidity, RH, was about 20%, and the wind read 9mph.

For the 15th of November, 2019 flights, we used an F67-9 motor. The Nov-15 weather was pretty calm. 1mph winds, about 30% humidity, 65°F. For the Feb 5th flights, a G77-10R/L motor was used. There was no wind, 66°F, 37% humidity. For the April-21 flights the first flight used a H128W-14 motor; the second used a G138T-14 motor. Wether: 9mph winds, 67°F, 24% humidity.

The “trimmed” files have been trimmed to contain only the flight data with a little pre- and post-flight data.

Note: The 5-Feb-21 flight data had a lot of interference from the GPS that was located too close to the logger. The trimmed and pruned file has beeen cut down to the flight data with just a little pre- and post-flight data, and it's had most of the bad points removed from the file.
