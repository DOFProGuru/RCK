    "text": "A model is a set of equations or computer code that describes the flight of the rocket. The forces and torques in a rocket model come from gravity, thrust, lift, and drag. Models are classified as 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D models. A 1-D model assumes that the rocket flies straight up and falls under parachute straight down. A 2-D (or 3 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel vertically and horizontally, and rotate in the 2-D plane of motion. A 3-D (or 6 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel in 3-D space and rotate about any of its three principal axes. The required modeling in E178 is:\nDevelop or prove an analytic 1-D model with constant thrust during motor burning, and a constant coefficient of drag during the flight. Learn to use a 2-D (3 DoF) open source program called Open Rocket to model and predict rocket behavior. Use this code for all three rockets you will construct. Develop and/or use a 1-D code to permit calculation of ùê∂ùê∑ and thrust curves from flight data."

This model assumes that the motor thrust is constant at the average level for the motor burn time. For example looking up the Estes C6 motor on ThrustCurve.org shows a total impulse of 8.8 Ns and a total burn time of 1.9 s. The motor would be modeled as generating a constant thrust of 8.8 Ns/1.9 s = 4.63 N for 1.9 s. Notice the listed average thrust is 4.7 N, which is close to the value we would specify, but not exactly the same. Which is correct? That would depend on what you think is correct.\n3 3-D models"

    "text": "General Hints\n\nBe sure to roughen all surfaces to be epoxied, with 60, 80, or 100 grit sandpaper before you glue so that the epoxy adheres better.\nGet an Aero Pack RA 38mm L motor retainer.\nSand the bottom 3/8‚Äù of the motor mount tube until the motor retainer slides on easily.\nReplace the elastic shock cord in the kit with 12 ft to 15 ft of either tubular/strap nylon or tubular/strap Kevlar, such as PML STRP-0.375, eRockets ER9044, Wildman KEVLAR1/4‚Äù, or Madcow SC_FLT_38_RED.\nUse either the PML mounting style or the Modified PML mounting style for the shock cord. For the PML style, follow steps 1 & 2 in the Phobos Instructions. You‚Äôll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord. The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be at least 3/8‚Äù from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2‚Äù to accomodate the motor retainer. When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow Batray instructions show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead of on the inside where it belongs.\nIf you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave the inside and outside edges square.\nConsider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube.\nUse the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the Phobos Instructions. When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins.\nWhen prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer rather than just a wood-screw end.\nWhen you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8‚Äù so that you can put a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. DO NOT make the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube. The LOC instructions say to, but they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off.\nFor the Vulcanite use Aeropoxy or BSI 30-minute epoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there‚Äôs no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60¬∞C (140¬∞F) for 3 hours. At home, shining an incandescent light an inch or so from the surface, or placing the part on the dashboard of a car in direct sunlight will provide sufficient heating.\nSecure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws. You can use the pan head screws but they don‚Äôt sit as flush.\nIf you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs with rail guides, either PML LRL-10-2 or Acme 54mm.\nSecure the motor retainer with a JB Weld."

    "text": "Step 7: Avionics Bay\nInstructions for cutting or modifying the plywood parts for the Avionics Bay are found here.\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Coupler, Switch Ring, Allthreads, Assembly Nuts and Washers, Screw Switch Holder, and Euroconnectors with Mounting Hardware\n\n\nSlide the Switch Ring over the Avionics Bay Coupler. Measure 2 7/8‚Äù (the midpoint) from one end and draw lines around both sides of the Switch Ring to mark where it is to be epoxied.\n\n\n\nMeasuring and Marking the Switch Ring Position on the Avionics Bay Coupler\n\n\nSlide the Switch Ring off of the markings and place a thin layer of epoxy between the lines then slide and rotate the switch ring into place. Secure the side without epoxy with blue tap to maintain its position, and remove as much of the excess epoxy as possible from the other side. In final assembly, body tubes will need to slide as flush as possible against the Switch Ring.\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Coupler and Switch Ring with Switch Ring Position Marked, Waiting for Epoxy\n\n\n\nOnce the epoxy has cured measure the circumference around the center of the switch ring.\nAs before mark three points equally spaced around the circumference in the center of the Switch Ring. You also need to mark points for accessing the Screw Switches. Easiest is to wrap a piece of paper around the ring and mark one circumference. Unwrap and measure the circumference and divide the distance by three and mark the paper accordingly. Calculate what 5/36ths of the circumference is and mark two points separated by that distance, centered between two of the other marks. The Screw Switches are separated by 50¬∞ and need to be centered between two vent holes.\nTransfer all five marks to the payload tube by wrapping the paper back around the tube and marking. Place the marks as close to the center of the Switch Ring as possible.\nDrill the three equally spaced holes with a drill bit with a size between a #52 and a #44. A 1/16‚Äù bit will work fine. Drill slowly to try to leave the inside edges of the holes as clean as possible.\nDrill the two Screw Switch Holes with a drill bit large enough to permit easy viewing of the switch screws and to permit easy access with a screwdriver.\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Bulkhead Pieces and Main Avionics Board Front View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Bulkhead Pieces and Main Avionics Board Back View\n\n\n\nIdentify the Inside Bulkheads (the ones with the slots) and the Outside Bulkheads (the ones without the slots). When assembled the Front Sides (the ones with the fewest burn marks) will be facing away from the Avionics Bay, and the back sides (the ones with the most burn marks) will be facing inside the bay. In addition, when assembled, the triangular pattern of three holes must be aligned between the Inside and Outside Bulkhead.\nApply a layer of epoxy or two layers of thin CA on the front (outside) surface of the Outside Bulkheads. This coating will make cleaning of black-powder residue easier. Let dry completely.\nFind six #10-24 bolts and six #10-24 nuts to use when clamping the bulkheads together as the glue dries.\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Bulkheads and Clamping Hardware\n\n\n\nPlace the six bolts through the Outside Bulkheads starting from the Front Surface.\nPlace white glue on the Front Surface of the Inner Bulkheads.\nSlide the Inner bulkheads onto the Outer Bulkheads making certain that all of the holes align.\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Bulkheads Ready for Gluing, Assembly, and Clamping\n\n\n\nThread the nuts onto the bolts and tighten securely.\nUse a wire or other thin tool to clear any glue out of the small holes\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Bulkheads Assembled and Clamped for the Glue to Dry\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Glued Avionics Bay Bulkheads and the Eyebolt Assembly Hardware\n\n\nLocate an eyebolt, a small-pattern #10-24 nut, a small #10 washer, a regular #10-24 nut, and a regular washer for each bulkhead assembly.\n\n\n\nThe locations of the #10-24 Small Pattern Nuts, Standard Nuts, the Small Washers and the Regular Washers for the Avionics Bay Eyebolts and Allthread\n\n\n\nFor each eyebolt, place the small-pattern nut followed by the small washer all of the way to the eye-end of the eyebolt. Secure it with CA, epoxy, or thread lock.\nInsert the eyebolt through the hole in the center of the Outside Bulkhead and secure using the regular washer and nut. These will be snugged against the Inside Bulkhead. Secure in place with CA, epoxy, or thread lock. Tighten securely.\n\n\n\n\nThe Assembled Avionics Bay Bulkheads before Trimming the Eyebolts\n\n\n\nCut off the eyebolts (Dremel or hacksaw) leaving about 1/4‚Äù-to-1/8‚Äù above the inside nuts and file or sand the ends to remove any sharp edges.\n\nNote The eyebolts and the cut-off pieces may be very hot (burn hazard) while and after you cut the eyebolts.\n\nTap the #4-40 Pilot Hole with a #4-40 tap.\nReinforce the threads with a couple of layers of thin CA. The CA will wick away from the tapped hole. The wicked CA will not harm anything.\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Main Board with #4-40 tap pointing at hole to tap\n\n\n\nTurn the Main Bard over so that you‚Äôre looking at the back side. If you get this orientation wrong, you will be unable to populate your Avionics Board without drilling additional holes.\nGlue the Large Battery Support into the lower slots (the ones just touching the two holes).\nGlue the Small Battery Support into the upper slots (the ones near the oval cutout).\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Main Board with Battery Support boards before gluing\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Main Board with Battery Support boards glued in position Bottom View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Main Board with Battery Support boards glued in position Side View\n\n\nTo see if you have trimmed the eyebolts sufficiently, and to get a feeling for how the interior of the Avionics Bay will look when assembled, place the Avionics Bay Main Board in the slots in the two inner bulkheads.\n\n\n\nThe Avionics Bay Bulkheads and Main Board as they will be assembled in the Avionics Bay. This is the Front Surface of the Main Board, where the Avionics will be installed. The top of the Main Board is on the left side\n\n\n\nTake the two pieces of 8‚Äù #10-24 Allthread and place two small-pattern nuts 6.50‚Äù from one end. In other words, the distance from the end of the allthread to the face of the first nut should be 6.50‚Äù. The second nut should be as close to touching the first nut as it can be while keeping the hex faces aligned. If you don‚Äôt keep the hex faces aligned, there will not be clearance between the nuts and the Euroconnector when you attempt to assemble the completed bay. Secure the nuts with thread lock, CA, or epoxy.\nTrim the short end of the Allthread (sticking past the two nuts), so that the total is between 6 13/16‚Äù and 6 7/8‚Äù in length. Do not trim the long end. You need to be able to put an additional nut on it.\n\n\n\n\nOne Allthread after securing two Small Pattern Nuts at 6.5‚Äù and trimming to length past the nuts\n\n\n\nAssemble the unpopulated Avionics Bay by placing the Main Board in one of the two bulkheads, sliding the Main Board and Bulkhead into the Couple and Switch Ring assembly, positioning the other bulkhead on the other end. It takes practice to get the slots in the Inner Bulkhead to line up with the tabs on the Main Board and have the Bulkhead slide into place.\nSecure the Avionics Bay assembly by threading the Allthreads through the both bulkheads and tightening a small washer and small-pattern nut on the end opposite the locked-in-place nuts."

The fit should be tight but smooth. Sand any centering rings that are too tight until they fit smoothly.\nHold the motor mount assembly next to the body tube at the position that it will be when epoxied in.

You need to be able to remove it once the epoxy sets.\nNOTE It is possible to epoxy the middle motor mount ring into position in the body tube, but the attempt to do so may get epoxy in lots of wrong places. You are on your own to do so. I recommend against it.\nPlace the body tube vertically in the support to hold the motor mount properly spaced while the epoxy cures.\n\n\n\nBody Tube and Motor Mount in Spacer while Curing\n\n\nMake sure the rocket is vertical until the epoxy cures."

We have more explicit instructions for it.\nFor the Small Teensy Data Logger,gather together\n\nTwo #4 .031‚Äù thick nylon washers\nTwo #4 3/16‚Äù (.188) nylon Spacers\nOne #4-40 3/8‚Äù (.375) screw\nOne #4-40 15/32‚Äù (.469) screw\nOne $4-40 standard nut\n\n\n\n\nThe Small Teensy Data Logger with mounting hardware\n\n\nInsert the 15/32‚Äù screw through the .031 washer, then through the Small Teensy near microUSB connector, then through a 3/16‚Äù spacer, then through the clearance hole between the oval cutout and the different-diameter holes on the Front Side of the Main Board. Thread the nut on the end but do not tighten.\nInsert the 3/8‚Äù screw through the .031 washer, then through the Small Teensy near microSD connector, then through a 3/16‚Äù spacer. Swing the board around to line the screw up with the threaded hole in the Main Board., and screw it into place. Do NOT overtighten. The threads in the plywood will not withstand a large load. The reason this screw does not have a matching nut is that there is not suficient space under the battery for a nut.\nFirmly tighten up the other screw. You want it to bear most of the load.\n\n\n\nThe Small Teensy Data Logger mounted on the Avionics Main Board. Note there is no nut for the rightmost screw.\n\n\nIf you are using the Large Teensy Board, mount it with four #4-40 screws, washers, spacers, and nuts. There is clearance of all four nuts.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark and Large Teensy Logger mounted on Avionics Bay Main Board\n\n\nGather together #2 mounting hardware for the Eggtimer Quark.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark wired with connectors and with mounting hardware\n\n\nMount it in position on the top surface of the Avionics Bay Main board below the Teensy.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark mounted on Avionics Bay Main Board\n\n\nAt some point you‚Äôll need to cut a piece of Velcro for securing the 7.4 V 2S 300 mAh (the taller battery for the Quark) to the main board. The 3.7 V 1S 400 mAh battery for the Teensy Data Logger (the flatter battery) will be secured with zip ties because there isn‚Äôt clearance for velcro between the battery and the switch holder.\n\n\n\nPlacement of the batteries and Battery Support Boards on the Main Avionics Board. The single zip tie over the black and res battery in the photo has been replaced with a strip of Velcro in the final design.\n\n\nTap the Screw Switch Holder with a #4-40 tap through the four switch mounting holes.\nPass one of the Allthreads with the secured nuts through one of the Bulkheads in the hole by the Eurostyle Connector. Placing a small #10 washer over the Allthread before it passes through the bulkhead is optional. This Bulkhead is now the Top Bulkhead.\nScrew the Allthread into and through the Switch Holder. The Switch Holder is symmetric, so it doesn‚Äôt matter which way you screw in the Allthread. The Allthread will need to extend about 3‚Äù beyond the Screw Holder. Screwing the Switch Holder a sufficient distance takes some ingenuity. Do not damage the threads in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Top Bulkhead, Allthread, and Screw Switch Holder with Screw Switches and mounting screws\n\n\nAttach two of the Screw Switches to the screw switch holder using black oxide #4-40 screws. You will need to sight the shiny stainless steel main screw in each switch, and the black oxide will make it easier to avoid identifying one of the mounting screws as the switch screw. Having the soldering tabs pointing up toward the Top Bulkhead will probably make routing the wires easier.\n\n\n\nThe Top Bulkhead, Allthread, and Screw Switch Holder with Screw Switches mounted\n\n\nYou will have to iteratively adjust the position os the Screw Switch Holder so that the screw switches can be switched on and off through the Switch Ring (maybe that‚Äôs where it got its name).\n\nTurn the Switch Holder so that the Screw Switches are facing outward and line the switch holder up with the Switch Holes in the Switch Ring in the Avionics Bay Coupler Tube.\nSlide the Allthread and Switch Holder into the Coupler Tube, and seat the Top Bulkhead in the top of the Avionics Bay Coupler Tube. Make sure the Allthread nuts are seated against the bulkhead. Check if you can clearly see the sitch screws through the screw switch holes. Determine if you need to raise or lower the Screw Switch Holder on the Allthread. Remove the bulkhead assembly from the Coupler Tube and make the adjustment.\nRepeat the cycle until the switch screws are centered in the Screw Swithc Holes.\n\nSlide the Bottom Bulkhead onto the Allthread (the side without the Eurostyle Connector).\nThread the other Allthread through the other side of the bulkhead near the Eurostyle Connector, and out through the Top Bulkhead.\nSecure the Allthreads with a small washer and a small-pattern #10 nut. You have a tool in your toolbox to make tightening the nuts easy.\nObserve if you can still see the switch screws centered in the holes. If not, disassemble and adjust things until you can.\nOnce everything is aligned, disassemble, place the batteries on the Main Board and assemble the Bulkheads, Main Board, and Allthreads without the Coupler Tube. The Switch Holder should fit over the 3.7 V 1S 400 mAh battery.\nWith everything in place, you will want to complete the wiring. Cut the wires to length, use the crimp connectors, and how to solder to the Screw Switches.\n\n\n\nThe Populated Avionics Bay with Large Teensy Data Logger, Front View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Populated Avionics Bay Back View"

    "text": "Step 2: Silicone Wiring and JST Connectors\nFor most of the wiring, use the 24 AWG flexible silicone-insulated wire. We have large spools of the red and black because most of the wiring is either power or ground, but feel free to use the other colors to color-code your assembly. The flexible silicone-insulated wire can be bent in very tight corners without damaging the wires, which is invaluable when wiring the electronics bay, where clearances are very tight.\nTwo of the three batteries use JST RCY connectors. The prototype also uses JST RCY connectors for connecting the recovery-charge screw terminals on the bulkheads to the Raven and AIM XTRA. You have two ways to attach JST connectors to your wiring. Best is to use the PA-09 crimping tool to crimp pins onto the 24 AWG flexible silicone-insulated wire, and then insert the pins into connector housings. This method will keep you from having non-flexible portions of the wire where spliced-and-soldered joints are. The JST Connector Crimping Procedure toward the bottom of the page has detailed instructions on using the crimp tool.\nThe second method is to use the pre-wired JST RCY connectors. They can be spliced in to existing wiring with solder and heat-shrink tubing. We have two kinds. The first is the really cheap kind with really thin wire and fairly inflexible insulation. These should ONLY be used for testing, never for actual electronics bay wiring. The second has a slightly heavier gauge wire and more flexible insulation (the seller claims it‚Äôs silicone, but it‚Äôs not). These can be used for electronics bay wiring.\n\n\n\nThe inexpensive and slightly better pre-wired JST RCX connectors\n\n\nThe thermistors and the Raven battery use the small Molex connectors. We have pre-wired connectors that are acceptable for use. The ones for thermistor connection can be used as is. The Raven battery one will probably have to be spliced into the rest of the wiring for the Raven. Don‚Äôt forget the heat-shrink tubing.\n\n\n\nThe Molex mini connectors"

    "section": "Stpe 3: Assembly",
    "text": "Stpe 3: Assembly\nThe assembly instruction sequence below is only one of many possible assembly sequences.\n\nYou may have to drill and tap the antenna support bulkhead and the forward battery bulkhead. I recommend 1/4‚Äù 4-40 screws.\n\nThe antenna support bulkhead and forward battery bulkhead are DIFFERENT from each other. Be sure to use one of each, and don‚Äôt make the other teams either have to machine the leftovers to work or laser cut new ones.\n\n\n\nThe Antenna and Battery Bulkheads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Antenna and Battery Bulkhead Drill and Tap Locations\n\n\n\nYou may need to drill vent holes through the top and bottom supports. They have been drilled through the outer tube, but may need to be drilled into the center section. Install the top and bottom supports with the low-profile #4 wood screws. Slide the outer tube on, making sure the screw-switch hole are visible through the slot in the outer tube when the thermistor holder openings are aligned with the threaded thermistor holder holes. With the outer tube in position, install the two thermistor holders with the #1-72 flat head wood screws. Then, drill the three altimeter vent holes the rest of the way into the top and bottom supports, and then disassemble the pieces.\nYou will need to create the wiring harnesses for the electronics. You may arrange things how you want. Connection to the screw switches is by far easiest if you use the crimp-on connectors and the crimping tool.\n\n\n\n\nThe crimping terminals for the screw switches and matching crimper\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wiring Harness\n\n\n\nThe recovery-charge screw terminals need to be installed in the top and bottom bulkheads. You‚Äôll want to determine if you want male or female JST connectors for the inside. The prototype rocket used both male connectors on each end, which were labeled with permanent marker as to AIM (A) or Raven (R). If you used one male and one female (and the matching connectors on the harness), you could not get them mixed up when assembling the electronics bay. Once you‚Äôve decided on the connectors, cut them so that the leads are fairly short, but still long enough to pass through the bulkheads and be soldered to the screw connectors. Make sure you know which way you want the screw connectors to face.\n\n\nPass the trimmed and stripped wires of the JST connector through the two holes from the inside to the outside.\nSolder the stripped wires to the screw connector, making sure the connector is oriented correctly with the connector holes pointed away from the allthread.\nFill the two holes and the space under the screw connector with silicone and push the screw connector against the bulkhead.\nPut a small daub of silicone on the inside between and around the two wires to anchor things from the inside.\nRepeat steps 1 through 4 for the other connector.\nRepeat steps 1 through 5 for the other bulkhead.\nLet the silicone cure before installing the bulkheads.\n\n\n\n\nThe recovery-charge screw terminals\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bolted Screw Eye and the Siliconed Wires on the Top Bulkhead\n\n\n\nThere are three batteries for the electronics bay. The computer side of the AIM XTRA should be powered by a 1000 mAh 3.7 V LiPo. The pyrotechnics/recovery charge side should be powered by a 300 mAh 7.4 V LiPo. The Raven should be powered by a 130 mAh or 170 mAh 3.7 V LiPo. The Raven is the back-up system, and the AIM XTRA is the main recovery system.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1000 mAh, 300 mAh, and 130 mAh LiPo batteries\n\n\n\nThe Raven requires #2 screws, nuts and spacers. It‚Äôs wise to put thin nylon washers below the screw heads to keep from shorting anything on the board. The AIM requires #4 screws threaded up through the bottom, with spacers and #4 small-pattern hex nuts on top. It‚Äôs probably best to mount the antenna support bulkhead now. The battery bulkhead needs to be attached at some point. This might be a good point to do so. Depending on how you wire the Raven, it may be easier to install the bulkhead either before or after wiring the Raven.\n\n\n\n\nThe mounting points for the AIM XTRA and the Raven\n\n\n\nThe screw switches mount on the underside of the electronics board but the electrical connection is on the top side. The stack from top to bottom is:\n\n\n#2 screw\n#2 brass washer\n#2 crimp connector\n#2 brass washer\nElectronics board\n2 ‚Äì #2 nylon washers\nscrew switch\n2 brass nut\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom View of the Screw Switches\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Antenna and Battery Bulkheads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top View of the Screw Switches and Crimp Connectors\n\n\n\nYou will need to keep track of the order of the switches for when you are powering the rocket. My chosen sequence was:\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Location\nPowers\n\n\n\n\nBottom (nearest AIM XTRA)\nAIM XTRA computer\n\n\nMiddle\nAIM XTRA pyrotechnics (electric matches)\n\n\nTop (nearest Raven)\nRaven\n\n\n\n\nThe thermistor conditioning board is mounted on top of the screw switches. It mounts using #2 screws (threaded up through the bottom), spacers, and nuts. You should consider using a #2 nylon washer between the top of the board and the nut to avoid shorting components. Most of the boards come with the 10-position screw terminal block installed. The terminal block makes installing the board and adding or removing wiring much easier, but it makes routing the thermistor connectors and wiring much more challenging. If you want or need a board without the connector, let me know. If your board does have the 10-pin connector, be sure to make sure the leads on the bottom side on the board are clipped so that they don‚Äôt short out against the screw switches under high-g loads.\nThe board layout with pin labels for the thermistor conditioning board is here. The schematic is here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Installed and Connected Thermistor Conditioning Board\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing clipped and unclipped leads on the Thermistor Conditioning Board\n\n\nThe wiring for the AIM XTRA has very little clearance between the AIM and the lower connector tube.\n\n\n\nRouting the wiring to the AIM XTRA\n\n\n\nOnce the wiring is complete, the Top and Bottom supports need to be installed. The 3D-printed lower support must be placed so that the slot lines up with the screw switches. The upper support covers the thermistor board and a small portion of the AIM XTRA. It‚Äôs easiest to feed the two thermistor connectors through the slots in the upper support at this point. Be sure not to bind or pinch any wires under the supports when you screw them down.\n\n\n\n\nThe Top and Bottom Supports\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top View of the Electronics Bay Partially Assembled\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom View of the Electronics Bay Partially Assembled\n\n\nThe #5 allthread rod is easiest to install at this point. It can be installed later, but is usually hard to slide through everything.\n\nAt this point, the batteries need to be added. The 1000 mAh 3.7 V LiPo goes on first, followed by the 300 mAh 7.4 V LiPo, and finally the 130 mAh or 170 mAh 3.7 V LiPo. The connectors and everything needs to fit in the battery compartment. There isn‚Äôt clearance to wrap electrical tape around the batteries to secure them unless you sand or grind places for the tape in the mounting board.\nThe top coupler tube needs to be slid over the batteries and mated with the center support. It is critical that the pyro connectors are accessible through the top of the coupler, and that none of the wires are pinched or trapped between the coupler and anything else. If you are not careful, it easy to strip or sever pinched wires. The top coupler tube has three threaded holes that will line up with the countersunk holes in the main parachute section. Be sure that the holes are aligned how you want them.\nThe Bottom coupler tube needs to be slid over the AIM XTRA and mated with the center support. It is critical that the pyro connectors are accessible through the bottom of the coupler, and that none of the wires are pinched or trapped between the coupler and anything else. If you are not careful, it easy to strip or sever pinched wires. The bottom coupler has two holes for shear pins that mate up with holes in your bottom body tube/motor mount. You want to make sure that when you put in the shear pins that the screw switches are on the opposite side of the rocket from the launch lugs. Otherwise, you will not be able to arm the rocket on the pad.\n\n\n\n\nThe Top and Bottom Couplers in Place\n\n\n\nThe pyro connectors from the AIM XTRA and the Raven must be connected with the pyro connectors in the top and bottom bulkheads. Make sure you know which is which, because you will use different amounts of black powder with the principal recovery (AIM) and the back-up recovery (Raven). After the pyro connectors are attached, slide the top and bottom bulkheads into position and secure them first with the component board lock plates and #4 screws. Then secure them with the #5 allthread, a washer, and a pair of #5 nuts on each end.\n\n\n\n\nThe Assembled Top End Bulkhead\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top View with No Cover\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom View with No Cover\n\n\n\nSlide the ebay cover over the assembled parts. Make sure that the screw holes are aligned with the screw slot on the bottom support and the threaded holes for the thermistor holders are visible.\n\n\n\n\nThe Top and Bottom Couplers in Place\n\n\n\nConnect the thermistors to the thermistor connectors and screw down the thermistor holders with #1-72 flat-head wood screws. Be careful not the strain the fine-gauge wires during any part of the assembly process. It often helps to have the AIM XTRA powered up and transmitting telemetry on the thermistors as you attach them, feed the excess wire into the hole and screw down the thermistor holders, to verify that they‚Äôre functioning. Be sure that the holders are pointing with the thermistors toward the rear of the rocket."

    "text": "Step 7: Motor Retainer\nThere are two motor retainers in your kit: A minimum-diameter retainer interior to your rocket, which we use primerily for attaching the shock cord, and a slim-line retainer for holding the motor in. However, the slim line has a fairly large detrimental effect on the performance of your rocket. Before installing the slim-line motor retainer, run flight simulations showing how much difference you have in performance (top speed and altitude) if you leave the retainer off or if you include it.\nWhether you use the minimum-diameter retainer for just securing the shock cord, or for also retaining the motor, it is CRITICAL that you secure the screw eye to the motor retainer with Loc-tite or CA. We have had the screw eye loosen and come free during descent, which led to the aft end of the rocket and motor casing falling from a substantial height, and failure of a Level 2 cert flight.\nIf you decide to install the slim-line motor retainer retainer and the adapter cone:\n\nThe transition and motor retainer should be installed last.\nMake sure that the transition and retainer are flush with each other when dry fit.\nUse JB Weld to install the motor retainer because it is so near the burning motor.\nThe retainer base has a threaded side that fits the threaded ring and one that doesn‚Äôt. Make sure that the threaded side is facing away from the rocket. Otherwise the retainer is pointless.\nDon‚Äôt forget to sand the outside of the tube where the motor retainer will join.\nThe retainer is designed for thick-walled tubes, not thin like we are using. You have to use a few extra steps to ensure the tube and retainer are aligned.\n\n-The steps are:\n\nGet an Aerotech motor casing and attach an aft closure after superlubing the threads.\nWrap parchment paper or wax paper around the motor casing and closure to keep epoxy from sticking to it.\nThread the motor casing through the motor retainer and secure the casing with the threaded ring.\nApply a generous amount of JB Weld to the outside of the lower body tube.\nThread the motor casing into the lower body tube, being sure to keep epoxy off the casing.\nTwist the motor-retainer assembly onto the lower body tube to make sure the JB Weld spreads evenly until it bottoms out.\nWipe off any JB Weld showing above the retainer.\nStand the tube vertically with the retainer on the bottom.\nAfter 20 minutes to an hour unscrew the threaded ring and make sure the motor tube can still slide smoothly. If so, reattach and tighten the threaded ring and stand the tube vertically with the retainer on the bottom for at least 12 hours.\nRemoved the motor casing.\nSecure the transition to the retainer with JB Weld."

That way the two sections will not collide with each other as the rocket descends. There are several methods for attaching the parachute to the shock cord.

    "text": "General Information\nFor the Class Rocket use Aeropoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there‚Äôs no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60¬∞C (140¬∞F) for 3 hours. You may use either the heat lamps or the Thermotron if it‚Äôs working.\nAlways dry fit parts before applying epoxy, and (wet) sand if necessary so that they fit properly. When sliding circular parts together, hold them so that the epoxy forms a fillet and doesn‚Äôt pool or drip off. The orientation is usually vertical.\nIf you slide two parts together, the epoxy will always be pushed forward off of the part on which the epoxy was applied. e.g, if you are epoxying a coupler to the inside of a body tube the excess epoxy will be on the inside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the inside of the body tube, and on the outside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the outside of the coupler. Twisting circular parts while pushing them together will spread the epoxy more evenly in the joint."

Place the Motor Mount in the Motor Retainer. Holding it in place with bule tape is not a bad idea.\n\n\n\nThe Motor Mount in the Motor Retainer\n\n\nWhile keeping the Motor Mount firmly in the motor retainer, align the lip of the Motor Retainer with the bottom of the Lower Body Tube. Place marks on the Motor Mount in line with the bottom of the fin slot. After making the marks, connect them with a ring that encircles the Motor Mount.

    "text": "Step 2: Motor Mount Assembly\nTest fit centering rings over the motor mount tube and sand centering rings if necessary.\nAlso test fit the centering rings in the body tube and sand the rings if necessary.\nPlace the inside part of your Estes motor retainer on one end of the motor mount tube. Make sure it is fully seated. Using a pen or pencil, mark the tube where the motor retainer hits the tube.\nScrew on the outside of the motor retainer.\nInsert the assembly into the slotted end of the rocket body tube so that the motor tube is still seated in the retainer and the outside of the retainer is resting against the body tube.\nUse a sharpened pencil or other marking implement that will reach and mark the location of the bottom of the bottom slot, and the top of the top slot on the motor mount tube.\nRemove the assembly and connect the marks to create two circles around the motor mount tube. If a centering ring will fit over the tube, you can use it as a guide for your circles. The space between the circles is where the fins will contact the motor mount tube and needs to be kept clear of epoxy or other materials while assembling the rocket before attaching the fins. The space between the ring for the top of the retainer and the bottom of the fins is where the bottom centering ring may be epoxied in place.\n\n\n\nThe Marked Motor Mount. Note: Tube is fully sanded.\n\n\nNote The strength of the bond between the fins and the motor mount can be greatly increased by putting internal fillets between the fins and motor mount tube, and the fins and the body tube. That strength is not needed for motors with 180 Ns of impulse and below, but should be considered if going above 180 Ns, and is required in the class 54mm fiberglass rocket. The next step makes creating internal fillets very difficult.\nSpread some epoxy on the outside of the motor tube somewhere between the retainer-ring mark and the bottom-of-the-fins mark and slide the bottom ring (without the notch) up the tube until it is centered between the marks, and wait for the epoxy to set. Be sure to clean off any epoxy that strayed beyond the lines.\nThe placement of the top ring (the one with the notch) isn‚Äôt critical: It should be above the top of the fin mark, but no closer than 1/4‚Äù from the end of the tube. Usually about 1/2‚Äù for the top of the tube is about right. Spread some epoxy on the outside of the motor tube at your chosen location and slide the top ring (with the notch) up the tube until it is in position, and wait for the epoxy to set. Be sure to clean off any epoxy that strayed into the fin or motor retainer zones.\n\n\n\nThe Motor Mount with Centering Rings.\n\n\nUsing JB-Weld (not any other epoxy) attach the inner part of the motor retainer to the bottom of the motor mount assembly. Spread the JB-Weld on the motor mount tube and not inside the motor retainer. Twist the motor retainer as you push it onto the tube.\nInspect the inside of the motor mount tube-motor retainer and thoroughly wipe away any JB-Weld that made it inside.\nPlace the assembly vertically (with the top notched ring pointed up), and let cure for at least 3 hours, preferably in a warm space. JB-Weld takes 24-48 hours to fully cure, but will usually not run after 3 hours."

Apply epoxy to the inside of the tube and push the bulkhead in so that the line is visible and wait until the glue sets. There are two pieces that can assist you. The first is a spacer that can be placed against the bulkhead to hold it at the correct depth until the epoxy cures. The second is a stand with room for the eyebolt to hang down that will let you hold the spacer and bulkhead in the proper position while the epoxy cures.\n\n\n\nThe Bulkhead Recessed in Coupler.\n\n\nApply a fillet of epoxy around the inside edge of the coupler bulkhead joint.\n\n\n\nThe Bulkhead/Coupler Fillet.\n\n\nMark a line around the coupler 2‚Äù from the open end.

Quickly wipe off any excess epoxy at the payload tube-coupler joint. The payload tube will not join properly with the body tube if you leave excess epoxy at the joint.\n\n\n\nThe Coupler/Payload Joint\n\n\nMeasure down 1 9/16‚Äù from the shoulder of the nose cone, and using an X-acto knife or a saw, cut off the bottom of the nose cone, and if necessary, sand the cut square.

Easiest is to wrap a piece of paper around the tube and mark one circumference. Unwrap and measure the circumference and divide the distance by three and mark the paper accordingly, then transfer the marks to the payload tube by wrapping the paper back around the tube and marking.\nHoles for Altimeter Vents: Repeat the marking procedure 1‚Äù above the coupler-payload tube edge.\nDrill all six holes with a #52, #51, or #50 bit. Drill slowly to try to leave the inside edges of the holes as clean as possible. You might consider drilling, tapping, and putting in a screw for the first hole before drilling the other five, to avoid the tube and nose cone rotating relative to each other.\nTap the top three holes with a #2-56 tap. These will secure the nose cone to the payload section.\nScrew a pan-head #2-56 screw into each threaded hole. These will hold the nose cone on during flight, but permit it to be removed to access the avionics.\nThe other three holes are to permit the altimeter to measure the free stream pressure outside the rocket for calculating the altitude.\nIf you are going to install an avionics carrier, you will want to put a layer of foam in the bottom of the payload section."

For the PML style, follow steps 1 & 2 in the Phobos Instructions. You‚Äôll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord. The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be at least 3/8‚Äù from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2‚Äù to accomodate the motor retainer. When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow Batray instructions show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead of on the inside where it belongs.\nIf you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave the inside and outside edges square.\nConsider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube.\nUse the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the Phobos Instructions. When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins.\nWhen prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer rather than just a wood-screw end.\nWhen you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8‚Äù so that you can put a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. DO NOT make the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube. The LOC instructions say to, but they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off.\nFor the Vulcanite use Aeropoxy or BSI 30-minute epoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there‚Äôs no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60¬∞C (140¬∞F) for 3 hours. At home, shining an incandescent light an inch or so from the surface, or placing the part on the dashboard of a car in direct sunlight will provide sufficient heating.\nSecure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws. You can use the pan head screws but they don‚Äôt sit as flush.\nIf you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs with rail guides, either PML LRL-10-2 or Acme 54mm.\nSecure the motor retainer with a JB Weld."

Apply epoxy to the inside of the tube and push the bulkhead in so that the line is visible and wait until the epoxy cures. Since BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy have such long cure times, you will want to support the Coupler and the Bulkhead until the epoxy cures. The photos below show some pieces of 1√ó2 and a free-cut 1/8‚Äù plywood ring (which is attached to the bulkhead with double-sided tape) used as a support.

Place the assembly vertically with the bulkhead end down until the epoxy cures. Remove the blue tape.\nThe epoxy is on the inside of the payload section instead of on the outside of the coupler, like in the Mini-DX3, because drips on the inside of this payload section are not as critical as in the Mini-DX3, and getting the payload section to join smoothly with the body tube is more critical for the Vulcanite.\n\n\n\nThe Coupler/Payload Joint with Blue Tape\n\n\nInsert the nose cone into the top of the payload tube and seat it securely.\nHoles for Payload ‚Äì Nose Cone Screws: Mark three points equally spaced around the circumference of the payload tube 1‚Äù below the end of the payload tube. Easiest is to wrap a piece of paper around the tube and mark one circumference. Unwrap and measure the circumference and divide the distance by three and mark the paper accordingly, then transfer the marks to the payload tube by wrapping the paper back around the tube and marking.\n\n\n\nThe Marking Guide for the Drill Holes on the Payload Section\n\n\nDrill one of the holes with a #43 bit through both the payload section and the nose cone.\nCountersink the hole, preferably with a 100¬∞ countersink. Stop before you hit the nose cone.\nTap the hole in the nose cone with a #4-40 tap.\nInsert and tighten a #4-40 100¬∞ flathead screw into the drilled, countersunk and tapped hole. The screw will keep the position of the nose cone stable.\nDrill, countersink, and tap the remaining two holes.\n\n\n\nThe Drilled, Countersunk, and Tapped Nose Cone/Payload Joint with Flathead Screws\n\n\nHoles for Altimeter Vents: Repeat the marking procedure 1‚Äù above the coupler-payload tube edge.\nDrill the three holes with a drill bit with a size between a #52 and a #44. A 1/16‚Äù bit will work fine. Drill slowly to try to leave the inside edges of the holes as clean as possible.\nIf you are going to install an avionics carrier, you may consider putting a layer of foam in the bottom of the payload section."

Many fliers prefer to make their rocket ‚Äúearn it‚Äôs paint‚Äù by flying it unpainted, and then painting it if it survives the first flight.\n\nYou should mark the center of pressure with a center-of-pressure symbol, which is a circle with a dot in the middle, ‚äô. A Sharpie¬Æ works great, but we do have water-slide decals if you want to get fancy.\nLabel the rocket with your name and cell-phone number on both the body tube and payload section. Again a Sharpie¬Æ works great, but you can use print-on adhesive labels or Sam‚Äôs labeling machine as well."

The required orientation is usually vertical.\nIf you slide two parts together, the epoxy will always be pushed forward off of the part on which the epoxy was applied. e.g, if you are epoxying a coupler to the inside of a body tube, the excess epoxy will be on the inside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the inside of the body tube, and on the outside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the outside of the coupler.\nTwisting circular parts while pushing them together will spread the epoxy more evenly in the joint.\nThere is a student-written TLDR talking about hints when following the instruction. It was written for the MiniDX3, but it still largely applies to the other Level 1 rockets.\nThere is a detailed student-written blog on putting the rocket together.

    "text": "Aerotech Arreaux Motors\n\nIt‚Äôs worth buying an extra-length motor-mount tubes when attempting the level 1 certification. A length of at least 15‚Äù will work for Aerotech 29/180 or shorter motors. You‚Äôll need to fiberglass your rocket to fly motors with more than 180 Ns of impulse. You will need a length of at least 16¬º‚Äù for the H115DM-14A, the H182R-14A, the H135W-14A, and the H195NT-14A, and a length of at least 19¬æ‚Äù for the I205W-14A. For the extra-length motor mount tube, you can either order the replacement motor mount tube from Aerotech, or eRockets.\nYou won‚Äôt need the 24 mm motor adaptor and don‚Äôt need to construct it. Most of the parts are no longer in the kit.\nYou need to attach the included motor retainer instead of the Motor Hook, Thrust Ring, and Thrust Ring Flange. These changes are detailed in the Arreaux Motor Retainer Upgrade Notice. Attaching the motor retainer should be done AFTER the rest of the rocket construction is completed (after Step 1 of the FINAL ASSEMBLY AND FINISHING in the instructions), otherewise it will block the application of the cyannoacrylate to the fin roots and the aft Centering Ring. Use JB Weld to attach it. The details are in the Aerotech 29 mm Motor Retainer Instructions (all on the Aerotech website http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/resources.aspx?id=4 near the bottom of the page).\nUse tapped holes and threaded #6 nylon screws to secure the nosecone to the payload section. Two is the minimum, three is recommended, four is allowed. Friction fitting with tape isn‚Äôt sufficient.\nIt‚Äôs often useful to be able to replace either the body or the payload/nosecone. The recessed screw eye on the payload section makes it difficult. You may want to make an extension out of 1/8‚Äù rope and a quik-link and attache the shock cord to the quik-link.\nMake sure you can dry-fit the fins BEFORE you CA them in place. You may need to sand down the ridges a little to be able to snap the fins into place."

    "section": "Folding a parachute",
    "text": "Folding a parachute\nThe goals in folding a parachute are the following:\n\nProtect the parachute from the hot gases and ash generated when the ejection charge goes off. Plastic-film chutes can form a tangled messy wad if contacted by the hot gases and ash. Nylon chutes can end up full of holes and function improperly.\nKeep the shroud lines from tangling during deployment.\nEnsure that the parachute slides easily into and out of the body tube, so it will deploy properly.\nEnsure that the parachute canopy inflates fully after ejection.\n\nBegin by stretching the parachute out by two opposing shroud lines to form a half circle (or half hexagon or half octagon, depending on how the chute is cut).\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Folded in Half\n\n\nThe illustrated chute is for the Vulcanite. It has eight shroud lines. In this case we fold the two outermost lines to meet in the center with the center shroud line. For a hexagonal (six shroud line) chute like for the miniDX3, you would fold so that the shroud lines meet the opposing shroud lines to form a triangle.\n\n\n\nThe First Two Folds\n\n\nIf necessary For an eight shroud line chute it‚Äôs necessary to fold the chute in half again to form a triangle. For a six shroud line chute, the first two folds of the 1/2 chute should have formed a triangle and the third fold is unnecessary.\n\n\n\nThe Third Fold\n\n\nWe are going to fold the shroud lines inside the chute to reduce the chances that they will tangle or get snagged on something during ejection. Place the shroud lined on top of the chute as shown.\n\n\n\nPlacing the Shroud Lines in the Triangle\n\n\nThen fold the triangle over the lines by bringing the two sets of shroud-line attachments together to form a thin right triangle. Then fold the long tip of the triangle down to the base (where the shock cord meets the shroud lines, and fold the remaining triangle tip over to form a rectangle as shown).\n\n\n\nProtecting the Shroud Lines in the Chute and forming a rectangle\n\n\nBeginning at the top of the rectangle (the side furthest from the shock cord), roll the chute tightly into a cylinder as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Fully Rolled\n\n\nPlace the chute in the center of the Chute Protector with the two parts of the shock cord going to your left, as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Chute Placed on the Chute Protector\n\n\nTake the lower corner of the chute protector and wrap it around and tuck it under the chute, like starting to roll a burrito, as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom of the Chute Protector Rolled around the Chute\n\n\nFold the two horizontal corners of the chute protector into the middle of the chute protector, just like you were rolling a burrito. The one shock cord will pass through the hole in the chute protector, and the other one will be routed approximately as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Sides Folded Over\n\n\nNow finish rolling up the chute inside the chute protector, like you were finishing a burrito or a spring roll. Try to ensure that none of the parachute is exposed outside of the chute protector. Any that is exposed is guaranteed to have a hole burned through it from the hot ejection gases and ash.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Fully Rolled in the Chute Protector\n\n\nAgain, to offer maximum protection to the chute, orient it so the end without the shock cords will enter the body tube first, and the end with the shock cords faces the nose cone or payload section.\n\n\n\nPreparing to Place the Chute in the Body Tube\n\n\nFirst place all of the shock cord that is below the parachute into the body tube with as few tangles and twists as possible. Then slide the parachute into the body tube. If you‚Äôve folded and rolled it correctly, it should slide into the body tube with very little effort. Slide it in as far as your finger will pushe it, and then place the remaining shock cord on top of it, and place the payload section or nose cone on top of the body tube.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Placed Largely in the Body Tube\n\n\nWhile I have found the illustrated method to be completely reliable, there are alternate methods for folding a parachute. Here are some of the alternates. - YA Method - Apogee Components - Apogee Components II - Queensland Rocketry - Rocketman - Fruity Chutes Iris."

    "text": "High Power Rockets fall under code 1127 of the National Fire Protection Association. The text for Code 1127 can be found here\nTo meet the definition of a High Power Rocket under NFPA 1127, it must meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nUses a motor with at least 160 Newton-seconds of impulse\nUses a motor with at least 80 Newtons average thrust or a hybrid motor\nExceeds 125 grams of propellant\nWeighs at least 1,500 grams\nHas airframe parts made out of ductile metal.\n\nWhen starting your journey to amateur high-powered rocketry certification, safety must always be your top priority. High-powered rocketry is an exhiting and rewarding experience, but it comes with inherent risks that require careful consideration to established safety protocols. Understanding and implementing these measures is crucial not only for your well-being but also for the safety of all individuals attending the launch.\nWhether you are getting certified through NAR or TRAit is important to look through their guidelines prior to your first launch. The NAR Safety Code and the TRA Safety Code outline exactly what is expected for a safe launch that meets the qualifications for certification.\n\nGeneral Safety\nIt is strongly advised for all participants in high-powered rocketry to secure appropriate insurance through either NAR or TRA. These organizations offer liability coverage specifically designed for rocketry activities, providing peace of mind for both you and the launch site hosts.\nMake sure that all persons, builings, trees, or other possible obstructions are beyond the minimum required distance of the lauch site for the duration of the launch.\n\n\nSafety While Epoxying\nAlways use a lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses when using epoxy. Repeated contact of epoxy with skin leads to very serious allergic reactions.\nAdhesives need to be used in a fume hood, a spray-paint booth, or outdoors away from any air inlets to buildings. Ensure adequate ventilation when using epoxy.\nGlass microspheres are an inhalation hazard. Use extreme caution and use a face mask if possible.\nThe following steps make for good epoxy joints:\n\nSand every surface to be epoxied (including interior surfaces) with 80-to-110 grit sandpaper.\nClean the surface with a lint-free cloth or Swiffer.\nFor fiberglass, metals, or pastics, wipe the surface down with acetone or isopropyl alcohol and let dry before using the epoxy. Not necessary for cardboard, plywood, or paper\nProtect any exterior surface where you don‚Äôt want scratches or sanding marks with blue or masking tape before you begin sanding.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and lighter (with a small decrease in strength) by mixing in glass or silica microspheres. A 1:1 volume ratio of microspheres to epoxy usually works well. You could use 1:2 or 2:1 if you wanted. This mixture works well for fillets that don‚Äôt need to support large loads.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and stiffer by mixing in chopped glass fibers. A 1:1 volume ratio of fibers to epoxy usually works well. If you want a smoother finish, use 1:2 or 1:3.\nEpoxy cures to a much higher strength if the joint is heated by a heat lamp or placed inside a heater while it cures. Do not let the joint heat above 140 ¬∞F (60 ¬∞C).\nIf you use spray paint, be sure that the location has proper ventilation.\nUse nitrile gloves, a face mask, and safety glasses when spray painting."

The thinking is that once you are certified, you can experiment with more complicated configurations, but the first order of business is to get certified. However, if you are a person who pays attention to detail and are willing to ground test before flight, you can certify on a more complex, and more expensive rocket.\nIf you choose your rocket carefully, you can certify both Level 1 and Level 2 on the same rocket (and on the same day, but most senior people recommend against same-day multi-certs)."

You can have someone already Level 1 or above buy it for you and give it to you when you‚Äôre ready to prep for launch. Some on-line vendors are willing to sell you one motor for certification purposes, or you can buy it at the launch site when you‚Äôre ready to prep for launch if there is an on-site vendor. On the complete list of approved motors, the naming of the motors is framed as (Impuse Class) (Average Thrust) - (Time Delay)(Color) The most popular choices for Level 1 and Level 2 certification are the Aerotech single use motor, an Aerotech reload, or a CTI reload. Both the Aerotech and CTI reloads require you to have a motor case. Aerotech single-use motors are slightly more expensive than either brand of reload, but the CTI cases for the reloads are expensive, and the Aerotech cases for the reloads are even more expensive. Many rocketeers have cases you can borrow for the most common Aerotech sizes, and a case or two for CTI motors, so a reload with a borrowed case is the cheapest way to go. For a SLE rocket, the top two choices are the Aerotech H128W-14A reload and the CTI H163-14A reload, but for SLE you can use any H reload that fits in the Aerotech 29/180 case or any H reload that fits in the CTI 29mm 3-grain case. Many vendors have a qualification discount for your first HP motor for a qualifying flight."

    "text": "Level 1 rocket recommendations\nThere are lots of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 qualification flights. By no means consider the list below to be exhaustive.\n\nMadcow 1.6‚Äù Mini DX3\nComing in at about $70, this rocket will easily let you certify Level 1 (assuming you include a GPS Tracker) if you follow the linked construction techniques. In addition to the kit, you will need an Estes 29mm motor retainer and 5-minute epoxy. The perfect cert motor for this rocket is the Aerotech H128W. Recommended assembly instructions are found here.\n\n\nEstes Pro Series II\nThe least expensive way to certify Level 1 is to buy an Estes Pro Series II with a 29 mm motor mount (not 24 mm) for between $20 and $40 and make the modifications to fly it on an H motor. The Super Big Bertha is an upscale of a classic Estes rocket and may be worth considering. If you can‚Äôt get Pro Series II rocket for around $20-to-$40, you‚Äôre better off spending your money on the Madcow or one of the other rockets below.\nTo modify a Pro Series II for an H motor: * Leave out the engine block on the motor mount if the kit has one. * Put epoxy fillets on the fin joints. * Replace the shock cord with 10 to 15 feet of kevlar and attach it to the motor mount or through the wall, not just glued on. * Consider replacing the existing 1/4‚Äù launch lugs with heftier 1/4‚Äù launch lugs or rail guides.\nThese rockets do not feature very rugged construction and will survive a few flights, but don‚Äôt plan on doing much more than qualifying on it. Available from Estes, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nAerotech Arreaux\nThe Aerotech Arreaux is an excellent SLE rocket. However, to fly H motors, you‚Äôll need to replace the stock 12‚Äù motor mount tube with a 15‚Äù or ~18‚Äù motor mount tube. See the construction hints below. Beyond the kit and the extra tube, all you need are CA adhesive and JB weld. We used modified Arreauxs in our classes for years. It‚Äôs much sturdier than the Estes Pro Series II, but not as sturdy as the Phobos, the Vulcanite, the Wildman Minis, or the Madcow thin-wall fiberglass. The rocket is available from Wildman, eRockets, Sirius, Apogee Components. The replacement motor mount tube is available from Aerotech, or eRockets.\n\n\nPML Phobos\nThe PML Phobos is an extremely rugged and reliable kit. If you pay attention to the instructions and are careful during construction it will last for years. You will want a motor retainer. You can certify Level 2 on it as well, but you‚Äôll want to make certain of your construction techniques. Available from LOC Precision, eRockets.\n\n\nLOC Precision Vulcanite\nYou will build a Vulcanite as part of Labs 4 and 5. The Vulcanite is a fairly rugged rocket that can be used for both Level 1 and Level 2 flights. It‚Äôs not quite as rugged as the PML Phobos. You‚Äôll want to order an Aero Pack Quick Change motor retainer. See building recommendations below if you want to try to cert Level 2 on it as well, or just want a very well constructed rocket. If you go for your Level 2 with it, you‚Äôll want to use the Aerotech J270W-14A motor with 0.6g of BP. Available from LOC Precision, Wildman, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nWildman Mini\nAny of the Wildman Mini series rockets will work very well as a Level 1 qualifying rocket. They are extremely sturdy and will last for years. Be sure to get the quick-change retainer. The Nomex chute protector is also useful, but may only last a few flights. Consider the dual deploy upgrade if you don‚Äôt want an SLE rocket. Available from Wildman.\n\n\nMadcow\nMadcow has a number of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 flights. The previous E190 Class Rocket was a modified version of the Madcow Go Devil 38. However, the instructions are much less detailed and are designed for more experienced builders. Consult Prof.¬†Spjut if you would like assistance with choosing a Madcow kit.\n\n\nApogee Components\nOne option to consider is the Apogee Peregrine. It is designed for dual deploy and will also work as a Level 2 rocket should you decide to use it. It has an amazing set of videos on construction if you need a little guidance. They also sell the Zephyr."
