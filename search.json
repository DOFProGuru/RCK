However, if you want to build a rocket to accomplish certain objectives, such as fly this high, or go this fast, you need a physical model of the rocket’s behavior.

This model assumes that the motor thrust is constant at the average level for the motor burn time. For example looking up the Estes C6 motor on ThrustCurve.org shows a total impulse of 8.8 Ns and a total burn time of 1.9 s. The motor would be modeled as generating a constant thrust of 8.8 Ns/1.9 s = 4.63 N for 1.9 s. Notice the listed average thrust is 4.7 N, which is close to the value we would specify, but not exactly the same. Which is correct? That would depend on what you think is correct.\n2-D models\n3-D models"

    "text": "Open Rocket is a Java app, but a group of dedicated volunteers have created installers for it. Go to Open Rocket to get a version that is appropriate for your computer and OS. There are some outdated hints for usage at Some Hints for Open Rocket. Open Rocket (and RasAero) can be used for a number of different tasks. The two principal ones are:\n\nDesigning a rocket from scratch or planning modifications to an existing kit to achieve some flight objectives.\nSelecting motors and delays for an existing kit, and verifying that the flight will be stable, safe, and stay within the flight-waiver altitude limit.\n\n\n\nThe basic procedure is to connect together a series of parts such as a nose cone, a body tube, a motor mount, fins, and a parachute, and then model how this collection of parts will fly when launched with a motor. Open Rocket has a huge database of parts from many different rocket kit manufacturers that have the dimensions, density, mass, and center of mass already entered. In addition, you can either specify all of these properties for any part from scratch, or edit the properties of an existing part in the database.\nWhen beginning from scratch or a kit, your process is to specify all of the components and their relative positions, and then have Open Rocket calculate the total mass, the center of mass, and the center of pressure for your rocket. You then load a model of a specific rocket motor, either from the large database within Open Rocket, downloaded from the web such as from Thrustcurve.org, or that you have created yourself, into your rocket model. Open Rocket will show you the relative positions of the center of mass and the center of pressure. If the center of pressure is not at least one calibre (body-tube diameter) behind the center of mass, you readjust the rocket model until the CP is one calibre behind the CM. Then you run the simulation and examine the results to see if the rocket reached a sufficient velocity before leaving the launch rod or launch rail, if the apogee is to your liking and is lower than the flight-waiver altitude limit where you will be flying, and if the parachute ejects within one second of apogee. If not, modify your ejection-charge delay time, choose a different motor, or modify the rocket parts until you achieve your objectives.\nOpen Rocket has tools for exporting parts of your design, such as the fins, for use in manufacturing. You can then build your rocket.\n\n\n\nOnce you have constructed your rocket, you will want to measure the actual mass and the actual center of mass. You will find that due to the mass of the adhesive, manufacturing variations, and other causes, your model will not exactly match the mass and center of mass that you calculated when designing the rocket or modeling the kit, although they should be fairly close. Open Rocket has overrides that you can enter for the mass and the center of mass, so you can match your measurements. You can then check if the CM with your chosen motor is at least one calibre in front of the CP. If so, you can run the simulation and examine the results to see if the rocket reached a sufficient velocity before leaving the launch rod or launch rail, if the apogee is to your liking and is lower than the flight-waiver altitude limit where you will be flying, and if the parachute ejects within one second of apogee. If not, you can modify your ejection-charge delay time and/or choose a different motor until you achieve your objectives.\nOpen Rocket has a database of common rocket kits, and many manufacturers provide RockSim models of their kits on their websites Open Rocket has a large number of Create an Open Rocket model of your LOC Weasel from the data you measured. Weigh your avionics assembly or the example model avionics assembly (use 84 g if you don’t have access to the avionics, or you don’t have access to a scale), and include it as a mass in your model. Record and report the model mass and center of mass as calculated by Open Rocket.\nRecord and report the actual model mass and center of mass for the example rocket. Comment on the differences from the modeled mass and CM.\n\n\n\nSimulate a flight of your LOC Weasel with an Aerotech F67-9W two different ways:\n\nUse Open Rocket and your measured mass and CM.\nUse the model from Assignment 1 and approximate the F67-9W thrust curve as you think appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nSimulate a flight of your LOC Weasel with an Aerotech H128-14A two different ways:\n\nUse Open Rocket and your measured mass and CM.\nUse your 1D model from practice problems 1 and approximate the H128-14A thrust curve as you think appropriate.\n\nFor ground conditions, use the likely or reported weather conditions at 9 am in Lucerne Valley on Saturday, 10 February 2024 Compare your results from the two models. Determine if the ejection happens before or after apogee. If it’s after apogee, determine the optimal delay adjustment so that the parachute ejects right at apogee. It is not cheating to use the column labeled “Optimum delay” in the Open Rocket results. Rerun your Open Rocket model with the optimal delay. Compare these results with the GPS altitude data from the Weasel H128W-14A flight on 07/08/2023 in 2023-07-08-LogExcel.xlsx."

    "text": "High-Power Rockets fall under code 1127 of the National Fire Protection Association. The text for Code 1127 can be found here\nTo meet the definition of a High-Power Rocket under NFPA 1127, it must meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nUses a motor with at least 160 Newton-seconds of impulse\nUses a motor with at least 80 Newtons average thrust or a hybrid motor\nExceeds 125 grams of propellant\nWeighs at least 1,500 grams\nHas airframe parts made out of ductile metal.\n\nWhen starting your journey to amateur high-powered rocketry certification, safety must always be your top priority. High-powered rocketry is an exhiting and rewarding experience, but it comes with inherent risks that require careful consideration to established safety protocols. Understanding and implementing these measures is crucial not only for your well-being but also for the safety of all individuals attending the launch.\nWhether you are getting certified through NAR or TRAit is important to look through their guidelines prior to your first launch. The NAR Safety Code and the TRA Safety Code outline exactly what is expected for a safe launch that meets the qualifications for certification.\n\nGeneral Safety\nIt is strongly advised for all participants in high-powered rocketry to secure appropriate insurance through either NAR or TRA. These organizations offer liability coverage specifically designed for rocketry activities, providing peace of mind for both you and the launch site hosts.\nMake sure that all persons, builings, trees, or other possible obstructions are beyond the minimum required distance of the lauch site for the duration of the launch.\n\n\nSafety While Epoxying\nAlways use a lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses when using epoxy. Repeated contact of epoxy with skin leads to very serious allergic reactions.\nAdhesives need to be used in a fume hood, a spray-paint booth, or outdoors away from any air inlets to buildings. Ensure adequate ventilation when using epoxy.\nGlass microspheres are an inhalation hazard. Use extreme caution and use a face mask if possible.\nThe following steps make for good epoxy joints:\n\nSand every surface to be epoxied (including interior surfaces) with 80-to-110 grit sandpaper.\nClean the surface with a lint-free cloth or Swiffer.\nFor fiberglass, metals, or pastics, wipe the surface down with acetone or isopropyl alcohol and let dry before using the epoxy. Not necessary for cardboard, plywood, or paper\nProtect any exterior surface where you don’t want scratches or sanding marks with blue or masking tape before you begin sanding.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and lighter (with a small decrease in strength) by mixing in glass or silica microspheres. A 1:1 volume ratio of microspheres to epoxy usually works well. You could use 1:2 or 2:1 if you wanted. This mixture works well for fillets that don’t need to support large loads.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and stiffer by mixing in chopped glass fibers. A 1:1 volume ratio of fibers to epoxy usually works well. If you want a smoother finish, use 1:2 or 1:3.\nEpoxy cures to a much higher strength if the joint is heated by a heat lamp or placed inside a heater while it cures. Do not let the joint heat above 140 °F (60 °C).\nIf you use spray paint, be sure that the location has proper ventilation.\nUse nitrile gloves, a face mask, and safety glasses when spray painting."

    "title": "Tutorial 4 – Barometric Altimeters",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Refer to Barometric Altitude, U.S. Standard Atmosphere, and Barometric formula for reference information on this assignment. You can also web search for pressure altitude and density altitude.\n\nAGL vs. MSL\nFor regulatory purposes, the altitude relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL) is important. The FAA mandates maximum altitudes that cannot be exceeded for high-power rocket flights in terms of MSL. For example, the usual waiver at ROC launches in Lucerne Valley is for 10,000 feet MSL. The waiver for our class launch is 17,500 feet MSL. For modeling and flight performance purposes, the important measurement is the altitude relative to the altitude of the launch site, called Above Ground Level (AGL). This assignment is looking principally at errors in AGL measurements. AGL is always calculated by taking the calculated (not measured) altitude MSL at the launch pad, \\(h_{0\\mathrm{_MSLcalc}}\\), and subtracting it from the calculated altitude MSL during flight, e.g.,\n\\[\n  h_\\mathrm{AGL} = h_\\mathrm{MSLcalc}-h_{0\\mathrm{_MSLcalc}}\n  \\].\nThe error in AGL is calculated as:\n\\[\n  \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{AGL}} = h_{\\mathrm{AGL}} - h_{\\mathrm{true}}\n  \\]\n\n\nBarometric Pressure Variations\nThe barometric pressure is calculated by measuring the local absolute pressure, and then using the standard atmospheric model to calculate the pressure one would expect at mean sea level. When you read the barometric pressure in a weather report, you always have to correct to your current altitude. Normal atmospheric pressure at mean sea level is 101,325 Pa, 1013.25 millibar (mb), or 1.01325 bar. High pressure regions rarely go above 1050 mb or below 982 mb.\n\nCreate a parametric plot that shows the error in MSL altitude from 0 m to 5000 m for \\(P_0 = 1050\\) mb and \\(P_0 = 982\\) mb as parameters\nCreate an additional parametric plot that shows the error in AGL from 0 m to 5000 m for \\(P_0 = 1050\\) mb and \\(P_0 = 982\\) mb as parameters.\n\n\n\nTemperature Variations\nThe Standard Atmospheric model assumes a temperature of 288.15 K (15°C) at mean sea level and a decrease of 6.5 K for every 1000 m gain in altitude. Obtaining data on variations in the lapse rate is challenging, but variations in ground temperature are fairly easy to measure. Lucerne Valley has a seasonal low of about –3°C and a seasonal high of about 38°C. Corrected for MSL, that is a \\(T_0\\) variation between 2.7°C and 43.7°C.\n\nCreate a parametric plot that shows the error in AGL from 0 m to 5000 m for \\(T_0 = 2.7\\)°C and \\(T_0 = 43.7\\)°C mb as parameters.\nNAR requires all official altitude record attempts (see Section 20.2.3) to have their pressure altimeter data corrected by multiplying the measured AGL by the ratio of the launch site temperature in K to 288.15 K. How well does the correction work for the data in this problem? Where did they get the 288.15 K in the ratio?\n\n\n\nRelative Humidity Variations\nWater has a molecular weight of 18.01528 g/mol or 0.01801528 kg/mol. Dry air has an average molecular weight of 28.9644 g/mol or 0.0289644 kg/mol. The density of air changes with the relative humidity. The relative humidity is defined as the partial pressure of water in the air divided by the vapor pressure of water at the air temperature.\nThe molecular weight of an air-water mixture is the mole-weighted average of the molecular weight of air and the molecular weight of water. In practice, it is easiest to calculate\n\\[\n   M_\\mathrm{mix} = \\frac{M_\\mathrm{air}P_\\mathrm{air}+M_\\mathrm{water}P_\\mathrm{water}}{P}\n   \\].\nwhere \\(M_{mix}\\) is the molecular weight of the air-water vapor mixture, \\(M_{air}\\) is the molecular weight of dry air, \\(M_{water}\\) is the molecular weight of water vapor, \\(P_{air}\\) is the partial pressure of dry air, \\(P_{water}\\) is the partial pressure of water vapor, and \\(P\\) is the overall pressure. Without measurements, it is difficult to know how the molecular weight of the air-water mixture varies with altitude. The easiest assumption is to measure the relative humidity (and of necessity, the temperature) at the launch site, calculate the molecular weight and assume it doesn’t change with altitude. Other assumptions require numerical integration of the pressure-altitude equations.\n\nCreate a parametric plot that shows the error in AGL from 0 m to 5000 m, for \\(H_r\\)’s of 50%, and 100% at 316.85 K. Don’t correct \\(T_0\\), just \\(M\\).\n\n\n\nPut It All Together\nThe linked data set contains the pressure-versus-time data for the first flight of the DX3 rocket on an F67-9W. Calculate the AGL altitude versus time both using the standard atmospheric model and applying the corrections for \\(T_0\\), \\(P_0\\), \\(h_0\\), and \\(H_r\\).\n\nFor this flight, how much of a difference did the corrections make?\nIf you were trying for a record altitude flight, which would you prefer: to fly on a cold day or a hot day, under a high pressure or under a low pressure, under a high humidity or under a low humidity?"

The resultant file sizes are:\n\n\n\nTime\nFile Size (MB)\n\n\n\n\n10s\n2.2\n\n\n30s\n6.5\n\n\n1 min\n13\n\n\n10 min\n130\n\n\n30 min\n390\n\n\n1 hr\n780\n\n\n\nThe code currently preallocates a file size of 780 MB (1 hour). If the logging is stopped before then, the file is resized to fit the logged data. If the logging is not stopped before the file size is reached, the logger closes the file at approximately 1 hour and waits for the next logging session to begin. If you suspect that the total time that your rocket may sit on the pad and spend in flight exceeds one hour, you can increase the preallocated file size by changing the LOG_FILE_SIZE definition.\nThese large file sizes mean that any software designed to process them is going to be very slow to parse the file and get it into memory."

At the current time the software to log the GPS data without disrupting the sampling of the other chips doesn’t work properly, so the GPS is not currently used.\nThe Featherweight GPS, which is used for ground tracking of the position of the flights, logs all of the GPS data, whether valid or not at 1 Hz. It also has the possibility to store the GPS data at 10 Hz for the most recent flight. It stores altitude data as feet MSL. In practice, the GPS does not lock as often as it should, and the most-recent-flight data storage works rarely. However, we do have both a log file and an on-board file for the GPS for this flight. We also have an already-processed spreadsheet of the log file. It has both the Weasel and a Vulcanite flight on it.\nThe files can be opened with a spreadsheet. Most of the column names are self explanatory. The TIME is in minutes and seconds, and wraps around on the hour. Again, the altitude (ALT) is MSL in feet (not meters).

Make sure it is fully seated. Using a pen or pencil, mark the tube where the motor retainer hits the tube.\nScrew on the outside of the motor retainer.\nInsert the assembly into the slotted end of the rocket body tube so that the motor tube is still seated in the retainer and the outside of the retainer is resting against the body tube.\nUse a sharpened pencil or other marking implement that will reach and mark the location of the bottom of the bottom slot, and the top of the top slot on the motor mount tube.\nRemove the assembly and connect the marks to create two circles around the motor mount tube. If a centering ring will fit over the tube, you can use it as a guide for your circles. The space between the circles is where the fins will contact the motor mount tube and needs to be kept clear of epoxy or other materials while assembling the rocket before attaching the fins. The space between the ring for the top of the retainer and the bottom of the fins is where the bottom centering ring may be epoxied in place.\n\n\n\nThe Marked Motor Mount. Note: Tube is fully sanded.\n\n\nNote The strength of the bond between the fins and the motor mount can be greatly increased by putting internal fillets between the fins and motor mount tube, and the fins and the body tube. That strength is not needed for motors with 180 Ns of impulse and below, but should be considered if going above 180 Ns, and is required in the class 54mm fiberglass rocket. The next step makes creating internal fillets very difficult.\nSpread some epoxy on the outside of the motor tube somewhere between the retainer-ring mark and the bottom-of-the-fins mark and slide the bottom ring (without the notch) up the tube until it is centered between the marks, and wait for the epoxy to set. Be sure to clean off any epoxy that strayed beyond the lines.\nThe placement of the top ring (the one with the notch) isn’t critical: It should be above the top of the fin mark, but no closer than 1/4” from the end of the tube. Usually about 1/2” for the top of the tube is about right. Spread some epoxy on the outside of the motor tube at your chosen location and slide the top ring (with the notch) up the tube until it is in position, and wait for the epoxy to set. Be sure to clean off any epoxy that strayed into the fin or motor retainer zones.\n\n\n\nThe Motor Mount with Centering Rings.\n\n\nUsing JB-Weld (not any other epoxy) attach the inner part of the motor retainer to the bottom of the motor mount assembly. Spread the JB-Weld on the motor mount tube and not inside the motor retainer. Twist the motor retainer as you push it onto the tube.\nInspect the inside of the motor mount tube-motor retainer and thoroughly wipe away any JB-Weld that made it inside.\nPlace the assembly vertically (with the top notched ring pointed up), and let cure for at least 3 hours, preferably in a warm space. JB-Weld takes 24-48 hours to fully cure, but will usually not run after 3 hours."

Apply insta-cure cyanoacrylate to the bolt in the crevices near the bolt so that the bolt does not become undone. After applying the cyanoacrylate, spray insta-set accelerator onto the applied surface so that the cyanoacrylate sets faster. Alternatively, instead of using cyanoacrylate and accelerator, you can epoxy where the bolt meets the nut.\nNote The coupler tube may be hidden inside either the payload tube or the body tube. Reach inside and slide it out.\n\n\n\nThe Assembled Bulkhead with the Screw Eye Trimmed.\n\n\nMark a line around the inside of the coupler tube 1/8” from the end. Apply epoxy to the inside of the tube and push the bulkhead in so that the line is visible and wait until the glue sets. There are two pieces that can assist you. The first is a spacer that can be placed against the bulkhead to hold it at the correct depth until the epoxy cures. The second is a stand with room for the eyebolt to hang down that will let you hold the spacer and bulkhead in the proper position while the epoxy cures.\n\n\n\nThe Bulkhead Recessed in Coupler.\n\n\nApply a fillet of epoxy around the inside edge of the coupler bulkhead joint.\n\n\n\nThe Bulkhead/Coupler Fillet.\n\n\nMark a line around the coupler 2” from the open end.

Quickly wipe off any excess epoxy at the payload tube-coupler joint. The payload tube will not join properly with the body tube if you leave excess epoxy at the joint.\n\n\n\nThe Coupler/Payload Joint\n\n\nMeasure down 1 9/16” from the shoulder of the nose cone, and using an X-acto knife or a saw, cut off the bottom of the nose cone, and if necessary, sand the cut square.

Easiest is to wrap a piece of paper around the tube and mark one circumference. Unwrap and measure the circumference and divide the distance by three and mark the paper accordingly, then transfer the marks to the payload tube by wrapping the paper back around the tube and marking.\nHoles for Altimeter Vents: Repeat the marking procedure 1” above the coupler-payload tube edge.\nDrill all six holes with a #52, #51, or #50 bit. Drill slowly to try to leave the inside edges of the holes as clean as possible. You might consider drilling, tapping, and putting in a screw for the first hole before drilling the other five, to avoid the tube and nose cone rotating relative to each other.\nTap the top three holes with a #2-56 tap. These will secure the nose cone to the payload section.\nScrew a pan-head #2-56 screw into each threaded hole. These will hold the nose cone on during flight, but permit it to be removed to access the avionics.\nThe other three holes are to permit the altimeter to measure the free stream pressure outside the rocket for calculating the altitude.\nIf you are going to install an avionics carrier, you will want to put a layer of foam in the bottom of the payload section."

    "text": "General Hints\n\nBe sure to roughen all surfaces to be epoxied, with 60, 80, or 100 grit sandpaper before you glue so that the epoxy adheres better.\nGet an Aero Pack RA 38mm L motor retainer.\nSand the bottom 3/8” of the motor mount tube until the motor retainer slides on easily.\nReplace the elastic shock cord in the kit with 12 ft to 15 ft of either tubular/strap nylon or tubular/strap Kevlar, such as PML STRP-0.375, eRockets ER9044, Wildman KEVLAR1/4”, or Madcow SC_FLT_38_RED.\nUse either the PML mounting style or the Modified PML mounting style for the shock cord. For the PML style, follow steps 1 & 2 in the Phobos Instructions. You’ll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord. The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be at least 3/8” from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2” to accomodate the motor retainer. When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow Batray instructions show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead of on the inside where it belongs.\nIf you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave the inside and outside edges square.\nConsider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube.\nUse the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the Phobos Instructions. When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins.\nWhen prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer rather than just a wood-screw end.\nWhen you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8” so that you can put a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. DO NOT make the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube. The LOC instructions say to, but they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off.\nFor the Vulcanite use Aeropoxy or BSI 30-minute epoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there’s no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60°C (140°F) for 3 hours. At home, shining an incandescent light an inch or so from the surface, or placing the part on the dashboard of a car in direct sunlight will provide sufficient heating.\nSecure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws. You can use the pan head screws but they don’t sit as flush.\nIf you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs with rail guides, either PML LRL-10-2 or Acme 54mm.\nSecure the motor retainer with a JB Weld."

Apply epoxy to the inside of the tube and push the bulkhead in so that the line is visible and wait until the epoxy cures. Since BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy have such long cure times, you will want to support the Coupler and the Bulkhead until the epoxy cures. The photos below show some pieces of 1×2 and a free-cut 1/8” plywood ring (which is attached to the bulkhead with double-sided tape) used as a support.

Place the assembly vertically with the bulkhead end down until the epoxy cures. Remove the blue tape.\nNote The epoxy is on the inside of the payload section instead of on the outside of the coupler, like in the Vulcanite, because drips on the inside of this payload section are not as critical as in the Mini-DX3, and getting the payload section to join smoothly with the body tube is more critical for the Vulcanite.\n\n\n\nThe Coupler/GPS Tube joint with Blue Tape\n\n\n\nInsert the nose cone into the top of the 5.5” GPS tube and seat it securely.\nHoles for GPS Bay – Nose Cone Screws: Mark three points equally spaced around the circumference of the 5.5” GPS tube 1” below the end of the 5.5” GPS tube.

The second nut should be as close to touching the first nut as it can be while keeping the hex faces aligned. If you don’t keep the hex faces aligned, there will not be clearance between the nuts and the Euroconnector when you attempt to assemble the completed bay. Secure the nuts with thread lock, CA, or epoxy.\nTrim the short end of the Allthread (sticking past the two nuts), so that the total is between 6 13/16” and 6 7/8” in length.

You need to be able to put an additional nut on it.\n\n\n\n\nOne Allthread after securing two Small Pattern Nuts at 6.5” and trimming to length past the nuts\n\n\n\nAssemble the unpopulated Avionics Bay by placing the Main Board in one of the two bulkheads, sliding the Main Board and Bulkhead into the Couple and Switch Ring assembly, positioning the other bulkhead on the other end. It takes practice to get the slots in the Inner Bulkhead to line up with the tabs on the Main Board and have the Bulkhead slide into place.\nSecure the Avionics Bay assembly by threading the Allthreads through the both bulkheads and tightening a small washer and small-pattern nut on the end opposite the locked-in-place nuts."

The fit should be tight but smooth. Sand any centering rings that are too tight until they fit smoothly.\nHold the motor mount assembly next to the body tube at the position that it will be when epoxied in. Measure how far up the body tube the top centering ring will be.\nUsing sandpaper attached to the end of a dowel, roughen up the inside of the body tube where the top centering ring will be attached.\nThe motor mount tube will need to protrude below the bottom of the body tube by about 1/8”. The easiest way to maintain the separation while the epoxy cures is to cut a hole in a piece of 1/8” plywood the size of the motor mount tube, as shown below. You can laser-cut a part suitable for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nThe Support for the Body Tube while the Motor Mount Cures\n\n\nUsing one or more craft (popsicle) sticks taped together, place a ring of epoxy inside the body tube about 1/4” short of where the front centering ring will sit.

Leave the 1/8” of the motor mount tube protruding out the bottom. You do want the bottom centering ring to be in position to keep the motor mount centered. You do not want the bottom centering ring to be glued in place. You need to be able to remove it once the epoxy sets.\nNOTE It is possible to epoxy the middle motor mount ring into position in the body tube, but the attempt to do so may get epoxy in lots of wrong places. You are on your own to do so. I recommend against it.\nPlace the body tube vertically in the support to hold the motor mount properly spaced while the epoxy cures.\n\n\n\nBody Tube and Motor Mount in Spacer while Curing\n\n\nMake sure the rocket is vertical until the epoxy cures."

You will need two of each, one set for each bulkhead.\n\n\n\nThe Euroconnector and Attachment Hardware Packaging\n\n\nCut two 6” lengths of black 20-AWG silicone wire and two 6” lengths of red 20-AWG silicone wire. Do NOT use any other wire. The 20-AWG can easily handle the current load, and the silicone wire is very flexible and can be used with very sharp corners.\nPush a black and a red wire through the holes at the base of the isosceles triangles on each bulkhead from the inside to the outside. It’s best if they have the same position on each bulkhead. Pull to a length of about 1”. Strip a small section of insulation from the short end of each wire, and tin it with solder. The tinning is to make the connection with the Eurostyle connector stronger.\nInsert each tinned wire into a separate screw terminals on the same side of a Eurostyle connector and screw down firmly to secure the connector to the wires.\nPlace a screw through the hole in the center of each Eurostyle connector, entering at the top (with the screw heads) and exiting through the bottom.\nStart the screw through the remaining hole in the Outer Bulkhead on each bulkhead.\nSimultaneously pull the wires and lower the Eurostyle connector to keep from kinking the wires and then secure the screw against the Inside Bulkhead with a washer and a nut.\n\n\n\nOne Avionics Bay Bulkhead with Eurostyle Connector and Wires Mounted Front View (Taken after first flight)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Avionics Bay Bulkhead with Eurostyle Connector and Wires Mounted Back View\n\n\nMount the Teensy Data Logger on the Top surface of the Avionics Bay Main Board. There are two styles, The Large Teensy Data Logger and the Small Teensy Data Logger. You will probably be given a Small Teensy Data Logger. We have more explicit instructions for it.\nFor the Small Teensy Data Logger,gather together\n\nTwo #4 .031” thick nylon washers\nTwo #4 3/16” (.188) nylon Spacers\nOne #4-40 3/8” (.375) screw\nOne #4-40 15/32” (.469) screw\nOne $4-40 standard nut\n\n\n\n\nThe Small Teensy Data Logger with mounting hardware\n\n\nInsert the 15/32” screw through the .031 washer, then through the Small Teensy near microUSB connector, then through a 3/16” spacer, then through the clearance hole between the oval cutout and the different-diameter holes on the Front Side of the Main Board. Thread the nut on the end but do not tighten.\nInsert the 3/8” screw through the .031 washer, then through the Small Teensy near microSD connector, then through a 3/16” spacer. Swing the board around to line the screw up with the threaded hole in the Main Board., and screw it into place. Do NOT overtighten. The threads in the plywood will not withstand a large load. The reason this screw does not have a matching nut is that there is not suficient space under the battery for a nut.\nFirmly tighten up the other screw. You want it to bear most of the load.\n\n\n\nThe Small Teensy Data Logger mounted on the Avionics Main Board. Note there is no nut for the rightmost screw.\n\n\nIf you are using the Large Teensy Board, mount it with four #4-40 screws, washers, spacers, and nuts. There is clearance of all four nuts.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark and Large Teensy Logger mounted on Avionics Bay Main Board\n\n\nGather together #2 mounting hardware for the Eggtimer Quark.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark wired with connectors and with mounting hardware\n\n\nMount it in position on the top surface of the Avionics Bay Main board below the Teensy.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark mounted on Avionics Bay Main Board\n\n\nAt some point you’ll need to cut a piece of Velcro for securing the 7.4 V 2S 300 mAh (the taller battery for the Quark) to the main board. The 3.7 V 1S 400 mAh battery for the Teensy Data Logger (the flatter battery) will be secured with zip ties because there isn’t clearance for velcro between the battery and the switch holder.\n\n\n\nPlacement of the batteries and Battery Support Boards on the Main Avionics Board. The single zip tie over the black and res battery in the photo has been replaced with a strip of Velcro in the final design.\n\n\nTap the Screw Switch Holder with a #4-40 tap through the four switch mounting holes.\nPass one of the Allthreads with the secured nuts through one of the Bulkheads in the hole by the Eurostyle Connector. Placing a small #10 washer over the Allthread before it passes through the bulkhead is optional. This Bulkhead is now the Top Bulkhead.\nScrew the Allthread into and through the Switch Holder. The Switch Holder is symmetric, so it doesn’t matter which way you screw in the Allthread. The Allthread will need to extend about 3” beyond the Screw Holder. Screwing the Switch Holder a sufficient distance takes some ingenuity. Do not damage the threads in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Top Bulkhead, Allthread, and Screw Switch Holder with Screw Switches and mounting screws\n\n\nAttach two of the Screw Switches to the screw switch holder using black oxide #4-40 screws. You will need to sight the shiny stainless steel main screw in each switch, and the black oxide will make it easier to avoid identifying one of the mounting screws as the switch screw. Having the soldering tabs pointing up toward the Top Bulkhead will probably make routing the wires easier.\n\n\n\nThe Top Bulkhead, Allthread, and Screw Switch Holder with Screw Switches mounted\n\n\nYou will have to iteratively adjust the position os the Screw Switch Holder so that the screw switches can be switched on and off through the Switch Ring (maybe that’s where it got its name).\n\nTurn the Switch Holder so that the Screw Switches are facing outward and line the switch holder up with the Switch Holes in the Switch Ring in the Avionics Bay Coupler Tube.\nSlide the Allthread and Switch Holder into the Coupler Tube, and seat the Top Bulkhead in the top of the Avionics Bay Coupler Tube. Make sure the Allthread nuts are seated against the bulkhead. Check if you can clearly see the sitch screws through the screw switch holes. Determine if you need to raise or lower the Screw Switch Holder on the Allthread. Remove the bulkhead assembly from the Coupler Tube and make the adjustment.\nRepeat the cycle until the switch screws are centered in the Screw Swithc Holes.\n\nSlide the Bottom Bulkhead onto the Allthread (the side without the Eurostyle Connector).\nThread the other Allthread through the other side of the bulkhead near the Eurostyle Connector, and out through the Top Bulkhead.\nSecure the Allthreads with a small washer and a small-pattern #10 nut. You have a tool in your toolbox to make tightening the nuts easy.\nObserve if you can still see the switch screws centered in the holes. If not, disassemble and adjust things until you can.\nOnce everything is aligned, disassemble, place the batteries on the Main Board and assemble the Bulkheads, Main Board, and Allthreads without the Coupler Tube. The Switch Holder should fit over the 3.7 V 1S 400 mAh battery.\nWith everything in place, you will want to complete the wiring. Cut the wires to length, use the crimp connectors, and how to solder to the Screw Switches.\n\n\n\nThe Populated Avionics Bay with Large Teensy Data Logger, Front View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Populated Avionics Bay Back View"

    "text": "Step 2: Silicone Wiring and JST Connectors\nFor most of the wiring, use the 24 AWG flexible silicone-insulated wire. We have large spools of the red and black because most of the wiring is either power or ground, but feel free to use the other colors to color-code your assembly. The flexible silicone-insulated wire can be bent in very tight corners without damaging the wires, which is invaluable when wiring the electronics bay, where clearances are very tight.\nTwo of the three batteries use JST RCY connectors. The prototype also uses JST RCY connectors for connecting the recovery-charge screw terminals on the bulkheads to the Raven and AIM XTRA. You have two ways to attach JST connectors to your wiring. Best is to use the PA-09 crimping tool to crimp pins onto the 24 AWG flexible silicone-insulated wire, and then insert the pins into connector housings. This method will keep you from having non-flexible portions of the wire where spliced-and-soldered joints are. The JST Connector Crimping Procedure toward the bottom of the page has detailed instructions on using the crimp tool.\nThe second method is to use the pre-wired JST RCY connectors. They can be spliced in to existing wiring with solder and heat-shrink tubing. We have two kinds. The first is the really cheap kind with really thin wire and fairly inflexible insulation. These should ONLY be used for testing, never for actual electronics bay wiring. The second has a slightly heavier gauge wire and more flexible insulation (the seller claims it’s silicone, but it’s not). These can be used for electronics bay wiring.\n\n\n\nThe inexpensive and slightly better pre-wired JST RCX connectors\n\n\nThe thermistors and the Raven battery use the small Molex connectors. We have pre-wired connectors that are acceptable for use. The ones for thermistor connection can be used as is. The Raven battery one will probably have to be spliced into the rest of the wiring for the Raven. Don’t forget the heat-shrink tubing.\n\n\n\nThe Molex mini connectors"

    "text": "Stpe 3: Assembly\nThe assembly instruction sequence below is only one of many possible assembly sequences.\n\nYou may have to drill and tap the antenna support bulkhead and the forward battery bulkhead. I recommend 1/4” 4-40 screws.\n\nThe antenna support bulkhead and forward battery bulkhead are DIFFERENT from each other. Be sure to use one of each, and don’t make the other teams either have to machine the leftovers to work or laser cut new ones.\n\n\n\nThe Antenna and Battery Bulkheads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Antenna and Battery Bulkhead Drill and Tap Locations\n\n\n\nYou may need to drill vent holes through the top and bottom supports. They have been drilled through the outer tube, but may need to be drilled into the center section. Install the top and bottom supports with the low-profile #4 wood screws. Slide the outer tube on, making sure the screw-switch hole are visible through the slot in the outer tube when the thermistor holder openings are aligned with the threaded thermistor holder holes. With the outer tube in position, install the two thermistor holders with the #1-72 flat head wood screws. Then, drill the three altimeter vent holes the rest of the way into the top and bottom supports, and then disassemble the pieces.\nYou will need to create the wiring harnesses for the electronics. You may arrange things how you want. Connection to the screw switches is by far easiest if you use the crimp-on connectors and the crimping tool.\n\n\n\n\nThe crimping terminals for the screw switches and matching crimper\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wiring Harness\n\n\n\nThe recovery-charge screw terminals need to be installed in the top and bottom bulkheads. You’ll want to determine if you want male or female JST connectors for the inside. The prototype rocket used both male connectors on each end, which were labeled with permanent marker as to AIM (A) or Raven (R). If you used one male and one female (and the matching connectors on the harness), you could not get them mixed up when assembling the electronics bay. Once you’ve decided on the connectors, cut them so that the leads are fairly short, but still long enough to pass through the bulkheads and be soldered to the screw connectors. Make sure you know which way you want the screw connectors to face.\n\n\nPass the trimmed and stripped wires of the JST connector through the two holes from the inside to the outside.\nSolder the stripped wires to the screw connector, making sure the connector is oriented correctly with the connector holes pointed away from the allthread.\nFill the two holes and the space under the screw connector with silicone and push the screw connector against the bulkhead.\nPut a small daub of silicone on the inside between and around the two wires to anchor things from the inside.\nRepeat steps 1 through 4 for the other connector.\nRepeat steps 1 through 5 for the other bulkhead.\nLet the silicone cure before installing the bulkheads.\n\n\n\n\nThe recovery-charge screw terminals\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bolted Screw Eye and the Siliconed Wires on the Top Bulkhead\n\n\n\nThere are three batteries for the electronics bay. The computer side of the AIM XTRA should be powered by a 1000 mAh 3.7 V LiPo. The pyrotechnics/recovery charge side should be powered by a 300 mAh 7.4 V LiPo. The Raven should be powered by a 130 mAh or 170 mAh 3.7 V LiPo. The Raven is the back-up system, and the AIM XTRA is the main recovery system.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1000 mAh, 300 mAh, and 130 mAh LiPo batteries\n\n\n\nThe Raven requires #2 screws, nuts and spacers. It’s wise to put thin nylon washers below the screw heads to keep from shorting anything on the board. The AIM requires #4 screws threaded up through the bottom, with spacers and #4 small-pattern hex nuts on top. It’s probably best to mount the antenna support bulkhead now. The battery bulkhead needs to be attached at some point. This might be a good point to do so. Depending on how you wire the Raven, it may be easier to install the bulkhead either before or after wiring the Raven.\n\n\n\n\nThe mounting points for the AIM XTRA and the Raven\n\n\n\nThe screw switches mount on the underside of the electronics board but the electrical connection is on the top side. The stack from top to bottom is:\n\n\n#2 screw\n#2 brass washer\n#2 crimp connector\n#2 brass washer\nElectronics board\n2 – #2 nylon washers\nscrew switch\n2 brass nut\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom View of the Screw Switches\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Antenna and Battery Bulkheads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top View of the Screw Switches and Crimp Connectors\n\n\n\nYou will need to keep track of the order of the switches for when you are powering the rocket. My chosen sequence was:\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Location\nPowers\n\n\n\n\nBottom (nearest AIM XTRA)\nAIM XTRA computer\n\n\nMiddle\nAIM XTRA pyrotechnics (electric matches)\n\n\nTop (nearest Raven)\nRaven\n\n\n\n\nThe thermistor conditioning board is mounted on top of the screw switches. It mounts using #2 screws (threaded up through the bottom), spacers, and nuts. You should consider using a #2 nylon washer between the top of the board and the nut to avoid shorting components. Most of the boards come with the 10-position screw terminal block installed. The terminal block makes installing the board and adding or removing wiring much easier, but it makes routing the thermistor connectors and wiring much more challenging. If you want or need a board without the connector, let me know. If your board does have the 10-pin connector, be sure to make sure the leads on the bottom side on the board are clipped so that they don’t short out against the screw switches under high-g loads.\nThe board layout with pin labels for the thermistor conditioning board is here. The schematic is here.\n\n\n\n\nThe Installed and Connected Thermistor Conditioning Board\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing clipped and unclipped leads on the Thermistor Conditioning Board\n\n\nThe wiring for the AIM XTRA has very little clearance between the AIM and the lower connector tube.\n\n\n\nRouting the wiring to the AIM XTRA\n\n\n\nOnce the wiring is complete, the Top and Bottom supports need to be installed. The 3D-printed lower support must be placed so that the slot lines up with the screw switches. The upper support covers the thermistor board and a small portion of the AIM XTRA. It’s easiest to feed the two thermistor connectors through the slots in the upper support at this point. Be sure not to bind or pinch any wires under the supports when you screw them down.\n\n\n\n\nThe Top and Bottom Supports\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top View of the Electronics Bay Partially Assembled\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom View of the Electronics Bay Partially Assembled\n\n\nThe #5 allthread rod is easiest to install at this point. It can be installed later, but is usually hard to slide through everything.\n\nAt this point, the batteries need to be added. The 1000 mAh 3.7 V LiPo goes on first, followed by the 300 mAh 7.4 V LiPo, and finally the 130 mAh or 170 mAh 3.7 V LiPo. The connectors and everything needs to fit in the battery compartment. There isn’t clearance to wrap electrical tape around the batteries to secure them unless you sand or grind places for the tape in the mounting board.\nThe top coupler tube needs to be slid over the batteries and mated with the center support. It is critical that the pyro connectors are accessible through the top of the coupler, and that none of the wires are pinched or trapped between the coupler and anything else. If you are not careful, it easy to strip or sever pinched wires. The top coupler tube has three threaded holes that will line up with the countersunk holes in the main parachute section. Be sure that the holes are aligned how you want them.\nThe Bottom coupler tube needs to be slid over the AIM XTRA and mated with the center support. It is critical that the pyro connectors are accessible through the bottom of the coupler, and that none of the wires are pinched or trapped between the coupler and anything else. If you are not careful, it easy to strip or sever pinched wires. The bottom coupler has two holes for shear pins that mate up with holes in your bottom body tube/motor mount. You want to make sure that when you put in the shear pins that the screw switches are on the opposite side of the rocket from the launch lugs. Otherwise, you will not be able to arm the rocket on the pad.\n\n\n\n\nThe Top and Bottom Couplers in Place\n\n\n\nThe pyro connectors from the AIM XTRA and the Raven must be connected with the pyro connectors in the top and bottom bulkheads. Make sure you know which is which, because you will use different amounts of black powder with the principal recovery (AIM) and the back-up recovery (Raven). After the pyro connectors are attached, slide the top and bottom bulkheads into position and secure them first with the component board lock plates and #4 screws. Then secure them with the #5 allthread, a washer, and a pair of #5 nuts on each end.\n\n\n\n\nThe Assembled Top End Bulkhead\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top View with No Cover\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom View with No Cover\n\n\n\nSlide the ebay cover over the assembled parts. Make sure that the screw holes are aligned with the screw slot on the bottom support and the threaded holes for the thermistor holders are visible.\n\n\n\n\nThe Top and Bottom Couplers in Place\n\n\n\nConnect the thermistors to the thermistor connectors and screw down the thermistor holders with #1-72 flat-head wood screws. Be careful not the strain the fine-gauge wires during any part of the assembly process. It often helps to have the AIM XTRA powered up and transmitting telemetry on the thermistors as you attach them, feed the excess wire into the hole and screw down the thermistor holders, to verify that they’re functioning. Be sure that the holders are pointing with the thermistors toward the rear of the rocket."

    "text": "Step 7: Motor Retainer\nThere are two motor retainers in your kit: A minimum-diameter retainer interior to your rocket, which we use primerily for attaching the shock cord, and a slim-line retainer for holding the motor in. However, the slim line has a fairly large detrimental effect on the performance of your rocket. Before installing the slim-line motor retainer, run flight simulations showing how much difference you have in performance (top speed and altitude) if you leave the retainer off or if you include it.\nWhether you use the minimum-diameter retainer for just securing the shock cord, or for also retaining the motor, it is CRITICAL that you secure the screw eye to the motor retainer with Loc-tite or CA. We have had the screw eye loosen and come free during descent, which led to the aft end of the rocket and motor casing falling from a substantial height, and failure of a Level 2 cert flight.\nIf you decide to install the slim-line motor retainer retainer and the adapter cone:\n\nThe transition and motor retainer should be installed last.\nMake sure that the transition and retainer are flush with each other when dry fit.\nUse JB Weld to install the motor retainer because it is so near the burning motor.\nThe retainer base has a threaded side that fits the threaded ring and one that doesn’t. Make sure that the threaded side is facing away from the rocket. Otherwise the retainer is pointless.\nDon’t forget to sand the outside of the tube where the motor retainer will join.\nThe retainer is designed for thick-walled tubes, not thin like we are using. You have to use a few extra steps to ensure the tube and retainer are aligned.\n\n-The steps are:\n\nGet an Aerotech motor casing and attach an aft closure after superlubing the threads.\nWrap parchment paper or wax paper around the motor casing and closure to keep epoxy from sticking to it.\nThread the motor casing through the motor retainer and secure the casing with the threaded ring.\nApply a generous amount of JB Weld to the outside of the lower body tube.\nThread the motor casing into the lower body tube, being sure to keep epoxy off the casing.\nTwist the motor-retainer assembly onto the lower body tube to make sure the JB Weld spreads evenly until it bottoms out.\nWipe off any JB Weld showing above the retainer.\nStand the tube vertically with the retainer on the bottom.\nAfter 20 minutes to an hour unscrew the threaded ring and make sure the motor tube can still slide smoothly. If so, reattach and tighten the threaded ring and stand the tube vertically with the retainer on the bottom for at least 12 hours.\nRemoved the motor casing.\nSecure the transition to the retainer with JB Weld."

In high-power rocketry, the parachute is rarely attached to the nose cone. It’s usually attached at the 1/3 — 2/3 point of the shock cord with the heavier section on the 2/3 side. That way the two sections will not collide with each other as the rocket descends. There are several methods for attaching the parachute to the shock cord. I prefer a figure-eight knot on a bight on the shock cord and then the usual lark’s head knot with the parachute shroud lines.\nOptional Payload Section If your rocket requires space for electronics beyond what will fit in the nose cone, you can add an optional payload section."

However, if you are a person who pays attention to detail and are willing to ground test before flight, you can certify on a more complex, and more expensive rocket.\nIf you choose your rocket carefully, you can certify both Level 1 and Level 2 on the same rocket (and on the same day, but most senior people recommend against same-day multi-certs)."

You can have someone already Level 1 or above buy it for you and give it to you when you’re ready to prep for launch. Some on-line vendors are willing to sell you one motor for certification purposes, or you can buy it at the launch site when you’re ready to prep for launch if there is an on-site vendor. On the complete list of approved motors, the naming of the motors is framed as (Impuse Class) (Average Thrust) - (Time Delay)(Color) The most popular choices for Level 1 and Level 2 certification are the Aerotech single use motor, an Aerotech reload, or a CTI reload. Both the Aerotech and CTI reloads require you to have a motor case. Aerotech single-use motors are slightly more expensive than either brand of reload, but the CTI cases for the reloads are expensive, and the Aerotech cases for the reloads are even more expensive. Many rocketeers have cases you can borrow for the most common Aerotech sizes, and a case or two for CTI motors, so a reload with a borrowed case is the cheapest way to go. For a SLE rocket, the top two choices are the Aerotech H128W-14A reload and the CTI H163-14A reload, but for SLE you can use any H reload that fits in the Aerotech 29/180 case or any H reload that fits in the CTI 29mm 3-grain case. Many vendors have a qualification discount for your first HP motor for a qualifying flight."

    "text": "Level 1 rocket recommendations\nThere are lots of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 qualification flights. By no means consider the list below to be exhaustive.\n\nMadcow 1.6” Mini DX3\nComing in at about $70, this rocket will easily let you certify Level 1 (assuming you include a GPS Tracker) if you follow the linked construction techniques. In addition to the kit, you will need an Estes 29mm motor retainer and 5-minute epoxy. The perfect cert motor for this rocket is the Aerotech H128W. Recommended assembly instructions are found here.\n\n\nEstes Pro Series II\nThe least expensive way to certify Level 1 is to buy an Estes Pro Series II with a 29 mm motor mount (not 24 mm) for between $20 and $40 and make the modifications to fly it on an H motor. The Super Big Bertha is an upscale of a classic Estes rocket and may be worth considering. If you can’t get Pro Series II rocket for around $20-to-$40, you’re better off spending your money on the Madcow or one of the other rockets below.\nTo modify a Pro Series II for an H motor: * Leave out the engine block on the motor mount if the kit has one. * Put epoxy fillets on the fin joints. * Replace the shock cord with 10 to 15 feet of kevlar and attach it to the motor mount or through the wall, not just glued on. * Consider replacing the existing 1/4” launch lugs with heftier 1/4” launch lugs or rail guides.\nThese rockets do not feature very rugged construction and will survive a few flights, but don’t plan on doing much more than qualifying on it. Available from Estes, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nAerotech Arreaux\nThe Aerotech Arreaux is an excellent SLE rocket. However, to fly H motors, you’ll need to replace the stock 12” motor mount tube with a 15” or ~18” motor mount tube. See the construction hints below. Beyond the kit and the extra tube, all you need are CA adhesive and JB weld. We used modified Arreauxs in our classes for years. It’s much sturdier than the Estes Pro Series II, but not as sturdy as the Phobos, the Vulcanite, the Wildman Minis, or the Madcow thin-wall fiberglass. The rocket is available from Wildman, eRockets, Sirius, Apogee Components. The replacement motor mount tube is available from Aerotech, or eRockets.\n\n\nLOC Precision (PML) Phobos\nThe PML Phobos is an extremely rugged and reliable kit. If you pay attention to the instructions and are careful during construction it will last for years. You will want a motor retainer. You can certify Level 2 on it as well, but you’ll want to make certain of your construction techniques. Available from LOC Precision, eRockets.\n\n\nLOC Precision Vulcanite\nYou will build a Vulcanite as part of Labs 4 and 5. The Vulcanite is a fairly rugged rocket that can be used for both Level 1 and Level 2 flights. It’s not quite as rugged as the PML Phobos. You’ll want to order an Aero Pack Quick Change motor retainer. See building recommendations below if you want to try to cert Level 2 on it as well, or just want a very well constructed rocket. If you go for your Level 2 with it, you’ll want to use the Aerotech J270W-14A motor with 0.6g of BP. Available from LOC Precision, Wildman, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nWildman Mini\nAny of the Wildman Mini series rockets will work very well as a Level 1 qualifying rocket. They are extremely sturdy and will last for years. Be sure to get the quick-change retainer. The Nomex chute protector is also useful, but may only last a few flights. Consider the dual deploy upgrade if you don’t want an SLE rocket. Available from Wildman.\n\n\nMadcow\nMadcow has a number of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 flights. The previous E190 Class Rocket was a modified version of the Madcow Go Devil 38. However, the instructions are much less detailed and are designed for more experienced builders. Consult Prof. Spjut if you would like assistance with choosing a Madcow kit.\n\n\nApogee Components\nOne option to consider is the Apogee Peregrine. It is designed for dual deploy and will also work as a Level 2 rocket should you decide to use it. It has an amazing set of videos on construction if you need a little guidance. They also sell the Zephyr."

For the PML style, follow steps 1 & 2 in the Phobos Instructions. You’ll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord. The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be at least 3/8” from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2” to accomodate the motor retainer. When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow Batray instructions show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead of on the inside where it belongs.\nIf you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave the inside and outside edges square.\nConsider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube.\nUse the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the Phobos Instructions. When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins.\nWhen prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer rather than just a wood-screw end.\nWhen you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8” so that you can put a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. DO NOT make the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube. The LOC instructions say to, but they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off.\nFor the Vulcanite use Aeropoxy or BSI 30-minute epoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there’s no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60°C (140°F) for 3 hours. At home, shining an incandescent light an inch or so from the surface, or placing the part on the dashboard of a car in direct sunlight will provide sufficient heating.\nSecure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws. You can use the pan head screws but they don’t sit as flush.\nIf you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs with rail guides, either PML LRL-10-2 or Acme 54mm.\nSecure the motor retainer with a JB Weld."

Apply epoxy to the inside of the tube and push the bulkhead in so that the line is visible and wait until the epoxy cures. Since BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy have such long cure times, you will want to support the Coupler and the Bulkhead until the epoxy cures.

Remove the blue tape.\nThe epoxy is on the inside of the payload section instead of on the outside of the coupler, like in the Mini-DX3, because drips on the inside of this payload section are not as critical as in the Mini-DX3, and getting the payload section to join smoothly with the body tube is more critical for the Vulcanite.\n\n\n\nThe Coupler/Payload Joint with Blue Tape\n\n\nInsert the nose cone into the top of the payload tube and seat it securely.\nHoles for Payload – Nose Cone Screws: Mark three points equally spaced around the circumference of the payload tube 1” below the end of the payload tube. Easiest is to wrap a piece of paper around the tube and mark one circumference. Unwrap and measure the circumference and divide the distance by three and mark the paper accordingly, then transfer the marks to the payload tube by wrapping the paper back around the tube and marking.\n\n\n\nThe Marking Guide for the Drill Holes on the Payload Section\n\n\nDrill one of the holes with a #43 bit through both the payload section and the nose cone.\nCountersink the hole, preferably with a 100° countersink. Stop before you hit the nose cone.\nTap the hole in the nose cone with a #4-40 tap.\nInsert and tighten a #4-40 100° flathead screw into the drilled, countersunk and tapped hole. The screw will keep the position of the nose cone stable.\nDrill, countersink, and tap the remaining two holes.\n\n\n\nThe Drilled, Countersunk, and Tapped Nose Cone/Payload Joint with Flathead Screws\n\n\nHoles for Altimeter Vents: Repeat the marking procedure 1” above the coupler-payload tube edge.\nDrill the three holes with a drill bit with a size between a #52 and a #44. A 1/16” bit will work fine. Drill slowly to try to leave the inside edges of the holes as clean as possible.\nIf you are going to install an avionics carrier, you may consider putting a layer of foam in the bottom of the payload section."

It was written primarily for the MiniDX3, but it still largely applies to the other Level 1 rockets.\nFor more information about safety precautions, visit DOFPro Rocketry Safety"

    "text": "Aerotech Arreaux Motors\n\nIt’s worth buying an extra-length motor-mount tubes when attempting the level 1 certification. A length of at least 15” will work for Aerotech 29/180 or shorter motors. You’ll need to fiberglass your rocket to fly motors with more than 180 Ns of impulse. You will need a length of at least 16¼” for the H115DM-14A, the H182R-14A, the H135W-14A, and the H195NT-14A, and a length of at least 19¾” for the I205W-14A. For the extra-length motor mount tube, you can either order the replacement motor mount tube from Aerotech, or eRockets.\nYou won’t need the 24 mm motor adaptor and don’t need to construct it. Most of the parts are no longer in the kit.\nYou need to attach the included motor retainer instead of the Motor Hook, Thrust Ring, and Thrust Ring Flange. These changes are detailed in the Arreaux Motor Retainer Upgrade Notice. Attaching the motor retainer should be done AFTER the rest of the rocket construction is completed (after Step 1 of the FINAL ASSEMBLY AND FINISHING in the instructions), otherewise it will block the application of the cyannoacrylate to the fin roots and the aft Centering Ring. Use JB Weld to attach it. The details are in the Aerotech 29 mm Motor Retainer Instructions (all on the Aerotech website http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/resources.aspx?id=4 near the bottom of the page).\nUse tapped holes and threaded #6 nylon screws to secure the nosecone to the payload section. Two is the minimum, three is recommended, four is allowed. Friction fitting with tape isn’t sufficient.\nIt’s often useful to be able to replace either the body or the payload/nosecone. The recessed screw eye on the payload section makes it difficult. You may want to make an extension out of 1/8” rope and a quik-link and attache the shock cord to the quik-link.\nMake sure you can dry-fit the fins BEFORE you CA them in place. You may need to sand down the ridges a little to be able to snap the fins into place."

    "title": "Construction Information",
    "section": "Folding a parachute",
    "text": "Folding a parachute\nThe goals in folding a parachute are the following:\n\nProtect the parachute from the hot gases and ash generated when the ejection charge goes off. Plastic-film chutes can form a tangled messy wad if contacted by the hot gases and ash. Nylon chutes can end up full of holes and function improperly.\nKeep the shroud lines from tangling during deployment.\nEnsure that the parachute slides easily into and out of the body tube, so it will deploy properly.\nEnsure that the parachute canopy inflates fully after ejection.\n\nBegin by stretching the parachute out by two opposing shroud lines to form a half circle (or half hexagon or half octagon, depending on how the chute is cut).\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Folded in Half\n\n\nThe illustrated chute is for the Vulcanite. It has eight shroud lines. In this case we fold the two outermost lines to meet in the center with the center shroud line. For a hexagonal (six shroud line) chute like for the miniDX3, you would fold so that the shroud lines meet the opposing shroud lines to form a triangle.\n\n\n\nThe First Two Folds\n\n\nIf necessary For an eight shroud line chute it’s necessary to fold the chute in half again to form a triangle. For a six shroud line chute, the first two folds of the 1/2 chute should have formed a triangle and the third fold is unnecessary.\n\n\n\nThe Third Fold\n\n\nWe are going to fold the shroud lines inside the chute to reduce the chances that they will tangle or get snagged on something during ejection. Place the shroud lined on top of the chute as shown.\n\n\n\nPlacing the Shroud Lines in the Triangle\n\n\nThen fold the triangle over the lines by bringing the two sets of shroud-line attachments together to form a thin right triangle. Then fold the long tip of the triangle down to the base (where the shock cord meets the shroud lines, and fold the remaining triangle tip over to form a rectangle as shown).\n\n\n\nProtecting the Shroud Lines in the Chute and forming a rectangle\n\n\nBeginning at the top of the rectangle (the side furthest from the shock cord), roll the chute tightly into a cylinder as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Fully Rolled\n\n\nPlace the chute in the center of the Chute Protector with the two parts of the shock cord going to your left, as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Chute Placed on the Chute Protector\n\n\nTake the lower corner of the chute protector and wrap it around and tuck it under the chute, like starting to roll a burrito, as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom of the Chute Protector Rolled around the Chute\n\n\nFold the two horizontal corners of the chute protector into the middle of the chute protector, just like you were rolling a burrito. The one shock cord will pass through the hole in the chute protector, and the other one will be routed approximately as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Sides Folded Over\n\n\nNow finish rolling up the chute inside the chute protector, like you were finishing a burrito or a spring roll. Try to ensure that none of the parachute is exposed outside of the chute protector. Any that is exposed is guaranteed to have a hole burned through it from the hot ejection gases and ash.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Fully Rolled in the Chute Protector\n\n\nAgain, to offer maximum protection to the chute, orient it so the end without the shock cords will enter the body tube first, and the end with the shock cords faces the nose cone or payload section.\n\n\n\nPreparing to Place the Chute in the Body Tube\n\n\nFirst place all of the shock cord that is below the parachute into the body tube with as few tangles and twists as possible. Then slide the parachute into the body tube. If you’ve folded and rolled it correctly, it should slide into the body tube with very little effort. Slide it in as far as your finger will pushe it, and then place the remaining shock cord on top of it, and place the payload section or nose cone on top of the body tube.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Placed Largely in the Body Tube\n\n\nWhile I have found the illustrated method to be completely reliable, there are alternate methods for folding a parachute. Here are some of the alternates. - YA Method - Apogee Components - Apogee Components II - Queensland Rocketry - Rocketman - Fruity Chutes Iris."

    "text": "General Information\nFor the Class Rocket use Aeropoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there’s no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60°C (140°F) for 3 hours. You may use either the heat lamps or the Thermotron if it’s working.\nAlways dry fit parts before applying epoxy, and (wet) sand if necessary so that they fit properly. When sliding circular parts together, hold them so that the epoxy forms a fillet and doesn’t pool or drip off. The orientation is usually vertical.\nIf you slide two parts together, the epoxy will always be pushed forward off of the part on which the epoxy was applied. e.g, if you are epoxying a coupler to the inside of a body tube the excess epoxy will be on the inside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the inside of the body tube, and on the outside of the body tube if you apply the epoxy to the outside of the coupler. Twisting circular parts while pushing them together will spread the epoxy more evenly in the joint."

The rings should slide without much effort but not be loose.\nWet sand the Motor Mount tube with 80-to-120 grit sandpaper over its entire length and clean off any remaining grit. Place the Motor Mount in the Motor Retainer. Holding it in place with bule tape is not a bad idea.\n\n\n\nThe Motor Mount in the Motor Retainer\n\n\nWhile keeping the Motor Mount firmly in the motor retainer, align the lip of the Motor Retainer with the bottom of the Lower Body Tube. Place marks on the Motor Mount in line with the bottom of the fin slot. After making the marks, connect them with a ring that encircles the Motor Mount. This line is not strictly necessary, but the Lower Centering Ring should not go above this line, to avoid interfering with the fins.\n\n\n\nThe Placement of the Line for the Centering Ring at the Base of the Motor Retainer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Placement of the Line for the Centering Ring at the Base of the Motor Retainer 2nd View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Placement of the Line for the Centering Ring at the Base of the Motor Retainer\n\n\nRepeat the above step, but at the top of the fin slot. You may find it useful to put an empty motor casing through the motor retainer ind into the Motor Mount to keep everything aligned. This line marks the lowest point where the upper centering ring can be placed to avoid interfering with the fins.

Make sure the Motor Mount is in the Motor Retainer. Slide the Motor Mount up into the Lower Body Tube and make sure the body tube rests against the lip of the motor retainer. Let the epoxy fully cure with the Lower Body Tube vertical and resting on the Motor Retainer. Make sure no epoxy gets on the Motor Retainer. You will need to remove it to apply the internal fillets."

You may not have anyone approach you to ask if you’re new here, but if you’re brave enough to ask, most rocketeers are more than willing to answer questions and get you started. There are two rocketry organizations in the US: the National Association of Rocketry, NAR, who focus on model rocketry, but also allow High-Power rockets; and the Tripoli Rocketry Association, TRA, who focus on High-Power and experimental rocketry, but also allow model rockets. The NAR Club Finder is here. The TRA Prefecture Finder is here.\nWe strongly recommend you build and fly a few model rockets before you think about High-Power. Model rockets have much lower costs to build and fly and mistakes are much less serious. Almost all of the building and flying lessons you learn from model rocketry will transfer to high-power rocketry.\nUnless you really enjoy government red tape, we strongly recommend you fly with a local club or prefecture, and don’t try to fly on your own. Model-rocket restrictions vary from state to state, but in California you must have written permission from the local fire department and from the landowner where you plan to launch. You also need to follow the Safety Code regarding distance from people and structures. It’s much easier to let someone else worry about the headaches, and you just go and fly."

The rocket will still fly, with or without the hyphen.↩︎\nThe rocket is a Quest Seeker modified to accommodate a PerfectFlite Pnut altimeter.↩︎\nThe rocket is a LOC Precision (PML) Phobos modified to accommodate a student-built avionics package. It’s currently loaded with a G motor, which isn’t High-Power, but it later flew on an I motor, which definitely is High-Power.↩︎\nOut Of Production – The manufacturer has quit making them, but you may still find some for sale at rocket vendors or perhaps on Ebay.↩︎\nAir Force Base↩︎\nNaval Air Station↩︎\nLos Angeles International Airport↩︎\nNotice to Air Missions↩︎\nLow Explosive User Permit – It’s no longer required after 2009, unless they want to hassle you about your black powder for ejection charges.↩︎\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives↩︎"
