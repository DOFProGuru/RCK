    "text": "High Power Rockets fall under code 1127 of the National Fire Protection Association. The text for Code 1127 can be found here\nTo meet the definition of a High Power Rocket under NFPA 1127, it must meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nUses a motor with at least 160 Newton-seconds of impulse\nUses a motor with at least 80 Newtons average thrust or a hybrid motor\nExceeds 125 grams of propellant\nWeighs at least 1,500 grams\nHas airframe parts made out of ductile metal.\n\nWhen starting your journey to amateur high-powered rocketry certification, safety must always be your top priority. High-powered rocketry is an exhiting and rewarding experience, but it comes with inherent risks that require careful consideration to established safety protocols. Understanding and implementing these measures is crucial not only for your well-being but also for the safety of all individuals attending the launch.\nWhether you are getting certified through NAR or TRAit is important to look through their guidelines prior to your first launch. The NAR Safety Code and the TRA Safety Code outline exactly what is expected for a safe launch that meets the qualifications for certification.\n\nGeneral Safety\nIt is strongly advised for all participants in high-powered rocketry to secure appropriate insurance through either NAR or TRA. These organizations offer liability coverage specifically designed for rocketry activities, providing peace of mind for both you and the launch site hosts.\nMake sure that all persons, builings, trees, or other possible obstructions are beyond the minimum required distance of the lauch site for the duration of the launch.\n\n\nSafety While Epoxying\nAlways use a lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses when using epoxy. Repeated contact of epoxy with skin leads to very serious allergic reactions.\nAdhesives need to be used in a fume hood, a spray-paint booth, or outdoors away from any air inlets to buildings. Ensure adequate ventilation when using epoxy.\nGlass microspheres are an inhalation hazard. Use extreme caution and use a face mask if possible.\nThe following steps make for good epoxy joints:\n\nSand every surface to be epoxied (including interior surfaces) with 80-to-110 grit sandpaper.\nClean the surface with a lint-free cloth or Swiffer.\nFor fiberglass, metals, or pastics, wipe the surface down with acetone or isopropyl alcohol and let dry before using the epoxy. Not necessary for cardboard, plywood, or paper\nProtect any exterior surface where you don’t want scratches or sanding marks with blue or masking tape before you begin sanding.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and lighter (with a small decrease in strength) by mixing in glass or silica microspheres. A 1:1 volume ratio of microspheres to epoxy usually works well. You could use 1:2 or 2:1 if you wanted. This mixture works well for fillets that don’t need to support large loads.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and stiffer by mixing in chopped glass fibers. A 1:1 volume ratio of fibers to epoxy usually works well. If you want a smoother finish, use 1:2 or 1:3.\nEpoxy cures to a much higher strength if the joint is heated by a heat lamp or placed inside a heater while it cures. Do not let the joint heat above 140 °F (60 °C).\nIf you use spray paint, be sure that the location has proper ventilation.\nUse nitrile gloves, a face mask, and safety glasses when spray painting."

    "text": "Step 2: Motor Mount Assembly\nTest fit centering rings over the motor mount tube and sand centering rings if necessary.\nAlso test fit the centering rings in the body tube and sand the rings if necessary.\nPlace the inside part of your Estes motor retainer on one end of the motor mount tube. Make sure it is fully seated. Using a pen or pencil, mark the tube where the motor retainer hits the tube.\nScrew on the outside of the motor retainer.\nInsert the assembly into the slotted end of the rocket body tube so that the motor tube is still seated in the retainer and the outside of the retainer is resting against the body tube.\nUse a sharpened pencil or other marking implement that will reach and mark the location of the bottom of the bottom slot, and the top of the top slot on the motor mount tube.\nRemove the assembly and connect the marks to create two circles around the motor mount tube. If a centering ring will fit over the tube, you can use it as a guide for your circles. The space between the circles is where the fins will contact the motor mount tube and needs to be kept clear of epoxy or other materials while assembling the rocket before attaching the fins. The space between the ring for the top of the retainer and the bottom of the fins is where the bottom centering ring may be epoxied in place.\n\n\n\nThe Marked Motor Mount. Note: Tube is fully sanded.\n\n\nNote The strength of the bond between the fins and the motor mount can be greatly increased by putting internal fillets between the fins and motor mount tube, and the fins and the body tube. That strength is not needed for motors with 180 Ns of impulse and below, but should be considered if going above 180 Ns, and is required in the class 54mm fiberglass rocket. The next step makes creating internal fillets very difficult.\nSpread some epoxy on the outside of the motor tube somewhere between the retainer-ring mark and the bottom-of-the-fins mark and slide the bottom ring (without the notch) up the tube until it is centered between the marks, and wait for the epoxy to set. Be sure to clean off any epoxy that strayed beyond the lines.\nThe placement of the top ring (the one with the notch) isn’t critical: It should be above the top of the fin mark, but no closer than 1/4” from the end of the tube. Usually about 1/2” for the top of the tube is about right. Spread some epoxy on the outside of the motor tube at your chosen location and slide the top ring (with the notch) up the tube until it is in position, and wait for the epoxy to set. Be sure to clean off any epoxy that strayed into the fin or motor retainer zones.\n\n\n\nThe Motor Mount with Centering Rings.\n\n\nUsing JB-Weld (not any other epoxy) attach the inner part of the motor retainer to the bottom of the motor mount assembly. Spread the JB-Weld on the motor mount tube and not inside the motor retainer. Twist the motor retainer as you push it onto the tube.\nInspect the inside of the motor mount tube-motor retainer and thoroughly wipe away any JB-Weld that made it inside.\nPlace the assembly vertically (with the top notched ring pointed up), and let cure for at least 3 hours, preferably in a warm space. JB-Weld takes 24-48 hours to fully cure, but will usually not run after 3 hours."

The Kevlar section will be attached to the motor mount and the nylon section will be attached to the payload section. Apply some epoxy like a fillet between the lower side of the top centering ring and the motor mount and wrap the Kevlar end of the shock cord around the motor mount into the epoxy. Make sure the cord lays flat enough so it will not interfere with the body tube when you slide the motor tube inside.

Reach inside and slide it out.\n\n\n\nThe Assembled Bulkhead with the Screw Eye Trimmed.\n\n\nMark a line around the inside of the coupler tube 1/8” from the end. Apply epoxy to the inside of the tube and push the bulkhead in so that the line is visible and wait until the glue sets. There are two pieces that can assist you. The first is a spacer that can be placed against the bulkhead to hold it at the correct depth until the epoxy cures. The second is a stand with room for the eyebolt to hang down that will let you hold the spacer and bulkhead in the proper position while the epoxy cures.\n\n\n\nThe Bulkhead Recessed in Coupler.\n\n\nApply a fillet of epoxy around the inside edge of the coupler bulkhead joint.\n\n\n\nThe Bulkhead/Coupler Fillet.\n\n\nMark a line around the coupler 2” from the open end. Apply a very thin amount of epoxy on the first inch of the outside of the coupler, and twist and slide the coupler into the payload tube (forward body tube) until you reach the 2” mark. Quickly wipe off any excess epoxy at the payload tube-coupler joint. The payload tube will not join properly with the body tube if you leave excess epoxy at the joint.\n\n\n\nThe Coupler/Payload Joint\n\n\nMeasure down 1 9/16” from the shoulder of the nose cone, and using an X-acto knife or a saw, cut off the bottom of the nose cone, and if necessary, sand the cut square. It will be pressing against the avionics carrier and should be as square as possible.\n\n\n\nThe Trimmed Nose Cone\n\n\nInsert the nose cone into the top of the payload tube.\n\n\n\nThe Payload with Nose Cone.\n\n\nHoles for Payload – Nose Cone Screws: Mark three points equally spaced around the circumference of the payload tube halfway between the shoulder and the end of the payload tube. Easiest is to wrap a piece of paper around the tube and mark one circumference. Unwrap and measure the circumference and divide the distance by three and mark the paper accordingly, then transfer the marks to the payload tube by wrapping the paper back around the tube and marking.\nHoles for Altimeter Vents: Repeat the marking procedure 1” above the coupler-payload tube edge.\nDrill all six holes with a #52, #51, or #50 bit. Drill slowly to try to leave the inside edges of the holes as clean as possible. You might consider drilling, tapping, and putting in a screw for the first hole before drilling the other five, to avoid the tube and nose cone rotating relative to each other.\nTap the top three holes with a #2-56 tap. These will secure the nose cone to the payload section.\nScrew a pan-head #2-56 screw into each threaded hole. These will hold the nose cone on during flight, but permit it to be removed to access the avionics.\nThe other three holes are to permit the altimeter to measure the free stream pressure outside the rocket for calculating the altitude.\nIf you are going to install an avionics carrier, you will want to put a layer of foam in the bottom of the payload section."

However, if you are a person who pays attention to detail and are willing to ground test before flight, you can certify on a more complex, and more expensive rocket.\nIf you choose your rocket carefully, you can certify both Level 1 and Level 2 on the same rocket (and on the same day, but most senior people recommend against same-day multi-certs)."

You can have someone already Level 1 or above buy it for you and give it to you when you’re ready to prep for launch. Some on-line vendors are willing to sell you one motor for certification purposes, or you can buy it at the launch site when you’re ready to prep for launch if there is an on-site vendor. On the complete list of approved motors, the naming of the motors is framed as (Impuse Class) (Average Thrust) - (Time Delay)(Color) The most popular choices for Level 1 and Level 2 certification are the Aerotech single use motor, an Aerotech reload, or a CTI reload. Both the Aerotech and CTI reloads require you to have a motor case. Aerotech single-use motors are slightly more expensive than either brand of reload, but the CTI cases for the reloads are expensive, and the Aerotech cases for the reloads are even more expensive. Many rocketeers have cases you can borrow for the most common Aerotech sizes, and a case or two for CTI motors, so a reload with a borrowed case is the cheapest way to go. For a SLE rocket, the top two choices are the Aerotech H128W-14A reload and the CTI H163-14A reload, but for SLE you can use any H reload that fits in the Aerotech 29/180 case or any H reload that fits in the CTI 29mm 3-grain case. Many vendors have a qualification discount for your first HP motor for a qualifying flight."

    "text": "Level 1 rocket recommendations\nThere are lots of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 qualification flights. By no means consider the list below to be exhaustive.\n\nMadcow 1.6” Mini DX3\nComing in at about $70, this rocket will easily let you certify Level 1 (assuming you include a GPS Tracker) if you follow the linked construction techniques. In addition to the kit, you will need an Estes 29mm motor retainer and 5-minute epoxy. The perfect cert motor for this rocket is the Aerotech H128W. Recommended assembly instructions are found here.\n\n\nEstes Pro Series II\nThe least expensive way to certify Level 1 is to buy an Estes Pro Series II with a 29 mm motor mount (not 24 mm) for between $20 and $40 and make the modifications to fly it on an H motor. The Super Big Bertha is an upscale of a classic Estes rocket and may be worth considering. If you can’t get Pro Series II rocket for around $20-to-$40, you’re better off spending your money on the Madcow or one of the other rockets below.\nTo modify a Pro Series II for an H motor: * Leave out the engine block on the motor mount if the kit has one. * Put epoxy fillets on the fin joints. * Replace the shock cord with 10 to 15 feet of kevlar and attach it to the motor mount or through the wall, not just glued on. * Consider replacing the existing 1/4” launch lugs with heftier 1/4” launch lugs or rail guides.\nThese rockets do not feature very rugged construction and will survive a few flights, but don’t plan on doing much more than qualifying on it. Available from Estes, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nAerotech Arreaux\nThe Aerotech Arreaux is an excellent SLE rocket. However, to fly H motors, you’ll need to replace the stock 12” motor mount tube with a 15” or ~18” motor mount tube. See the construction hints below. Beyond the kit and the extra tube, all you need are CA adhesive and JB weld. We used modified Arreauxs in our classes for years. It’s much sturdier than the Estes Pro Series II, but not as sturdy as the Phobos, the Vulcanite, the Wildman Minis, or the Madcow thin-wall fiberglass. The rocket is available from Wildman, eRockets, Sirius, Apogee Components. The replacement motor mount tube is available from Aerotech, or eRockets.\n\n\nPML Phobos\nThe PML Phobos is an extremely rugged and reliable kit. If you pay attention to the instructions and are careful during construction it will last for years. You will want a motor retainer. You can certify Level 2 on it as well, but you’ll want to make certain of your construction techniques. Available from LOC Precision, eRockets.\n\n\nLOC Precision Vulcanite\nYou will build a Vulcanite as part of Labs 4 and 5. The Vulcanite is a fairly rugged rocket that can be used for both Level 1 and Level 2 flights. It’s not quite as rugged as the PML Phobos. You’ll want to order an Aero Pack Quick Change motor retainer. See building recommendations below if you want to try to cert Level 2 on it as well, or just want a very well constructed rocket. If you go for your Level 2 with it, you’ll want to use the Aerotech J270W-14A motor with 0.6g of BP. Available from LOC Precision, Wildman, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nWildman Mini\nAny of the Wildman Mini series rockets will work very well as a Level 1 qualifying rocket. They are extremely sturdy and will last for years. Be sure to get the quick-change retainer. The Nomex chute protector is also useful, but may only last a few flights. Consider the dual deploy upgrade if you don’t want an SLE rocket. Available from Wildman.\n\n\nMadcow\nMadcow has a number of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 flights. The previous E190 Class Rocket was a modified version of the Madcow Go Devil 38. However, the instructions are much less detailed and are designed for more experienced builders. Consult Prof. Spjut if you would like assistance with choosing a Madcow kit.\n\n\nApogee Components\nOne option to consider is the Apogee Peregrine. It is designed for dual deploy and will also work as a Level 2 rocket should you decide to use it. It has an amazing set of videos on construction if you need a little guidance. They also sell the Zephyr."

A length of at least 15” will work for Aerotech 29/180 or shorter motors. You’ll need to fiberglass your rocket to fly motors with more than 180 Ns of impulse. You will need a length of at least 16¼” for the H115DM-14A, the H182R-14A, the H135W-14A, and the H195NT-14A, and a length of at least 19¾” for the I205W-14A. For the extra-length motor mount tube, you can either order the replacement motor mount tube from Aerotech, or eRockets.\nYou won’t need the 24 mm motor adaptor and don’t need to construct it. Most of the parts are no longer in the kit.\nYou need to attach the included motor retainer instead of the Motor Hook, Thrust Ring, and Thrust Ring Flange. These changes are detailed in the Arreaux Motor Retainer Upgrade Notice. Attaching the motor retainer should be done AFTER the rest of the rocket construction is completed (after Step 1 of the FINAL ASSEMBLY AND FINISHING in the instructions), otherewise it will block the application of the cyannoacrylate to the fin roots and the aft Centering Ring. Use JB Weld to attach it. The details are in the Aerotech 29 mm Motor Retainer Instructions (all on the Aerotech website http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/resources.aspx?id=4 near the bottom of the page).\nUse tapped holes and threaded #6 nylon screws to secure the nosecone to the payload section. Two is the minimum, three is recommended, four is allowed. Friction fitting with tape isn’t sufficient.\nIt’s often useful to be able to replace either the body or the payload/nosecone. The recessed screw eye on the payload section makes it difficult. You may want to make an extension out of 1/8” rope and a quik-link and attache the shock cord to the quik-link.\nMake sure you can dry-fit the fins BEFORE you CA them in place.

    "section": "Folding a parachute",
    "text": "Folding a parachute\nThe goals in folding a parachute are the following:\n\nProtect the parachute from the hot gases and ash generated when the ejection charge goes off. Plastic-film chutes can form a tangled messy wad if contacted by the hot gases and ash. Nylon chutes can end up full of holes and function improperly.\nKeep the shroud lines from tangling during deployment.\nEnsure that the parachute slides easily into and out of the body tube, so it will deploy properly.\nEnsure that the parachute canopy inflates fully after ejection.\n\nBegin by stretching the parachute out by two opposing shroud lines to form a half circle (or half hexagon or half octagon, depending on how the chute is cut).\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Folded in Half\n\n\nThe illustrated chute is for the Vulcanite. It has eight shroud lines. In this case we fold the two outermost lines to meet in the center with the center shroud line. For a hexagonal (six shroud line) chute like for the miniDX3, you would fold so that the shroud lines meet the opposing shroud lines to form a triangle.\n\n\n\nThe First Two Folds\n\n\nIf necessary For an eight shroud line chute it’s necessary to fold the chute in half again to form a triangle. For a six shroud line chute, the first two folds of the 1/2 chute should have formed a triangle and the third fold is unnecessary.\n\n\n\nThe Third Fold\n\n\nWe are going to fold the shroud lines inside the chute to reduce the chances that they will tangle or get snagged on something during ejection. Place the shroud lined on top of the chute as shown.\n\n\n\nPlacing the Shroud Lines in the Triangle\n\n\nThen fold the triangle over the lines by bringing the two sets of shroud-line attachments together to form a thin right triangle. Then fold the long tip of the triangle down to the base (where the shock cord meets the shroud lines, and fold the remaining triangle tip over to form a rectangle as shown).\n\n\n\nProtecting the Shroud Lines in the Chute and forming a rectangle\n\n\nBeginning at the top of the rectangle (the side furthest from the shock cord), roll the chute tightly into a cylinder as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Fully Rolled\n\n\nPlace the chute in the center of the Chute Protector with the two parts of the shock cord going to your left, as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Chute Placed on the Chute Protector\n\n\nTake the lower corner of the chute protector and wrap it around and tuck it under the chute, like starting to roll a burrito, as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom of the Chute Protector Rolled around the Chute\n\n\nFold the two horizontal corners of the chute protector into the middle of the chute protector, just like you were rolling a burrito. The one shock cord will pass through the hole in the chute protector, and the other one will be routed approximately as shown.\n\n\n\nThe Sides Folded Over\n\n\nNow finish rolling up the chute inside the chute protector, like you were finishing a burrito or a spring roll. Try to ensure that none of the parachute is exposed outside of the chute protector. Any that is exposed is guaranteed to have a hole burned through it from the hot ejection gases and ash.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Fully Rolled in the Chute Protector\n\n\nAgain, to offer maximum protection to the chute, orient it so the end without the shock cords will enter the body tube first, and the end with the shock cords faces the nose cone or payload section.\n\n\n\nPreparing to Place the Chute in the Body Tube\n\n\nFirst place all of the shock cord that is below the parachute into the body tube with as few tangles and twists as possible. Then slide the parachute into the body tube. If you’ve folded and rolled it correctly, it should slide into the body tube with very little effort. Slide it in as far as your finger will pushe it, and then place the remaining shock cord on top of it, and place the payload section or nose cone on top of the body tube.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Placed Largely in the Body Tube\n\n\nWhile I have found the illustrated method to be completely reliable, there are alternate methods for folding a parachute. Here are some of the alternates. - YA Method - Apogee Components - Apogee Components II - Queensland Rocketry - Rocketman - Fruity Chutes Iris."

    "text": "General Hints\n\nBe sure to roughen all surfaces to be epoxied, with 60, 80, or 100 grit sandpaper before you glue so that the epoxy adheres better.\nGet an Aero Pack RA 38mm L motor retainer.\nSand the bottom 3/8” of the motor mount tube until the motor retainer slides on easily.\nReplace the elastic shock cord in the kit with 12 ft to 15 ft of either tubular/strap nylon or tubular/strap Kevlar, such as PML STRP-0.375, eRockets ER9044, Wildman KEVLAR1/4”, or Madcow SC_FLT_38_RED.\nUse either the PML mounting style or the Modified PML mounting style for the shock cord. For the PML style, follow steps 1 & 2 in the Phobos Instructions. You’ll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord. The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be at least 3/8” from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2” to accomodate the motor retainer. When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow Batray instructions show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead of on the inside where it belongs.\nIf you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave the inside and outside edges square.\nConsider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube.\nUse the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the Phobos Instructions. When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins.\nWhen prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer rather than just a wood-screw end.\nWhen you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8” so that you can put a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. DO NOT make the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube. The LOC instructions say to, but they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off.\nFor the Vulcanite use Aeropoxy or BSI 30-minute epoxy for all assembly except for attaching the motor retainer, where you will use JBWeld, and for the initial attachment of the fins, where you can use BSI 5-minute epoxy instead. Do not use 5-minute epoxy on any of the fin fillets.\nFor the BSI 30-minute or Aeropoxy, wait until the epoxy has cured sufficiently that there’s no danger of running and then heat treat it at 60°C (140°F) for 3 hours. At home, shining an incandescent light an inch or so from the surface, or placing the part on the dashboard of a car in direct sunlight will provide sufficient heating.\nSecure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws. You can use the pan head screws but they don’t sit as flush.\nIf you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs with rail guides, either PML LRL-10-2 or Acme 54mm.\nSecure the motor retainer with a JB Weld."

You will need two of each, one set for each bulkhead.\n\n\n\nThe Euroconnector and Attachment Hardware Packaging\n\n\nCut two 6” lengths of black 20-AWG silicone wire and two 6” lengths of red 20-AWG silicone wire. Do NOT use any other wire. The 20-AWG can easily handle the current load, and the silicone wire is very flexible and can be used with very sharp corners.\nPush a black and a red wire through the holes at the base of the isosceles triangles on each bulkhead from the inside to the outside. It’s best if they have the same position on each bulkhead. Pull to a length of about 1”. Strip a small section of insulation from the short end of each wire, and tin it with solder. The tinning is to make the connection with the Eurostyle connector stronger.\nInsert each tinned wire into a separate screw terminals on the same side of a Eurostyle connector and screw down firmly to secure the connector to the wires.\nPlace a screw through the hole in the center of each Eurostyle connector, entering at the top (with the screw heads) and exiting through the bottom.\nStart the screw through the remaining hole in the Outer Bulkhead on each bulkhead.\nSimultaneously pull the wires and lower the Eurostyle connector to keep from kinking the wires and then secure the screw against the Inside Bulkhead with a washer and a nut.\n\n\n\nOne Avionics Bay Bulkhead with Eurostyle Connector and Wires Mounted Front View (Taken after first flight)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Avionics Bay Bulkhead with Eurostyle Connector and Wires Mounted Back View\n\n\nMount the Teensy Data Logger on the Top surface of the Avionics Bay Main Board. There are two styles, The Large Teensy Data Logger and the Small Teensy Data Logger. You will probably be given a Small Teensy Data Logger. We have more explicit instructions for it.\nFor the Small Teensy Data Logger,gather together\n\nTwo #4 .031” thick nylon washers\nTwo #4 3/16” (.188) nylon Spacers\nOne #4-40 3/8” (.375) screw\nOne #4-40 15/32” (.469) screw\nOne $4-40 standard nut\n\n\n\n\nThe Small Teensy Data Logger with mounting hardware\n\n\nInsert the 15/32” screw through the .031 washer, then through the Small Teensy near microUSB connector, then through a 3/16” spacer, then through the clearance hole between the oval cutout and the different-diameter holes on the Front Side of the Main Board. Thread the nut on the end but do not tighten.\nInsert the 3/8” screw through the .031 washer, then through the Small Teensy near microSD connector, then through a 3/16” spacer. Swing the board around to line the screw up with the threaded hole in the Main Board., and screw it into place. Do NOT overtighten. The threads in the plywood will not withstand a large load. The reason this screw does not have a matching nut is that there is not suficient space under the battery for a nut.\nFirmly tighten up the other screw. You want it to bear most of the load.\n\n\n\nThe Small Teensy Data Logger mounted on the Avionics Main Board. Note there is no nut for the rightmost screw.\n\n\nIf you are using the Large Teensy Board, mount it with four #4-40 screws, washers, spacers, and nuts. There is clearance of all four nuts.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark and Large Teensy Logger mounted on Avionics Bay Main Board\n\n\nGather together #2 mounting hardware for the Eggtimer Quark.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark wired with connectors and with mounting hardware\n\n\nMount it in position on the top surface of the Avionics Bay Main board below the Teensy.\n\n\n\nThe Eggtimer Quark mounted on Avionics Bay Main Board\n\n\nAt some point you’ll need to cut a piece of Velcro for securing the 7.4 V 2S 300 mAh (the taller battery for the Quark) to the main board. The 3.7 V 1S 400 mAh battery for the Teensy Data Logger (the flatter battery) will be secured with zip ties because there isn’t clearance for velcro between the battery and the switch holder.\n\n\n\nPlacement of the batteries and Battery Support Boards on the Main Avionics Board. The single zip tie over the black and res battery in the photo has been replaced with a strip of Velcro in the final design.\n\n\nTap the Screw Switch Holder with a #4-40 tap through the four switch mounting holes.\nPass one of the Allthreads with the secured nuts through one of the Bulkheads in the hole by the Eurostyle Connector. Placing a small #10 washer over the Allthread before it passes through the bulkhead is optional. This Bulkhead is now the Top Bulkhead.\nScrew the Allthread into and through the Switch Holder. The Switch Holder is symmetric, so it doesn’t matter which way you screw in the Allthread. The Allthread will need to extend about 3” beyond the Screw Holder. Screwing the Switch Holder a sufficient distance takes some ingenuity. Do not damage the threads in the process.\n\n\n\nThe Top Bulkhead, Allthread, and Screw Switch Holder with Screw Switches and mounting screws\n\n\nAttach two of the Screw Switches to the screw switch holder using black oxide #4-40 screws. You will need to sight the shiny stainless steel main screw in each switch, and the black oxide will make it easier to avoid identifying one of the mounting screws as the switch screw. Having the soldering tabs pointing up toward the Top Bulkhead will probably make routing the wires easier.\n\n\n\nThe Top Bulkhead, Allthread, and Screw Switch Holder with Screw Switches mounted\n\n\nYou will have to iteratively adjust the position os the Screw Switch Holder so that the screw switches can be switched on and off through the Switch Ring (maybe that’s where it got its name).\n\nTurn the Switch Holder so that the Screw Switches are facing outward and line the switch holder up with the Switch Holes in the Switch Ring in the Avionics Bay Coupler Tube.\nSlide the Allthread and Switch Holder into the Coupler Tube, and seat the Top Bulkhead in the top of the Avionics Bay Coupler Tube. Make sure the Allthread nuts are seated against the bulkhead. Check if you can clearly see the sitch screws through the screw switch holes. Determine if you need to raise or lower the Screw Switch Holder on the Allthread. Remove the bulkhead assembly from the Coupler Tube and make the adjustment.\nRepeat the cycle until the switch screws are centered in the Screw Swithc Holes.\n\nSlide the Bottom Bulkhead onto the Allthread (the side without the Eurostyle Connector).\nThread the other Allthread through the other side of the bulkhead near the Eurostyle Connector, and out through the Top Bulkhead.\nSecure the Allthreads with a small washer and a small-pattern #10 nut. You have a tool in your toolbox to make tightening the nuts easy.\nObserve if you can still see the switch screws centered in the holes. If not, disassemble and adjust things until you can.\nOnce everything is aligned, disassemble, place the batteries on the Main Board and assemble the Bulkheads, Main Board, and Allthreads without the Coupler Tube. The Switch Holder should fit over the 3.7 V 1S 400 mAh battery.\nWith everything in place, you will want to complete the wiring. Cut the wires to length, use the crimp connectors, and how to solder to the Screw Switches.\n\n\n\nThe Populated Avionics Bay with Large Teensy Data Logger, Front View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Populated Avionics Bay Back View"

    "text": "A model is a set of equations or computer code that describes the flight of the rocket. The forces and torques in a rocket model come from gravity, thrust, lift, and drag. Models are classified as 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D models. A 1-D model assumes that the rocket flies straight up and falls under parachute straight down. A 2-D (or 3 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel vertically and horizontally, and rotate in the 2-D plane of motion. A 3-D (or 6 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel in 3-D space and rotate about any of its three principal axes. The required modeling in E178 is:\nDevelop or prove an analytic 1-D model with constant thrust during motor burning, and a constant coefficient of drag during the flight. Learn to use a 2-D (3 DoF) open source program called Open Rocket to model and predict rocket behavior. Use this code for all three rockets you will construct. Develop and/or use a 1-D code to permit calculation of 𝐶𝐷 and thrust curves from flight data."

    "text": "Analytical with Constant Thrust and Constant Drag Coefficient\nThis is the simplest model that does a good job of describing a rocket flight up to ejection and is useful for processing data to determine total impulse, total burn time, and an average C~D. This model assumes that the motor thrust is constant at the average level for the motor burn time. For example looking up the Estes C6 motor on ThrustCurve.org shows a total impulse of 8.8 Ns and a total burn time of 1.9 s. The motor would be modeled as generating a constant thrust of 8.8 Ns/1.9 s = 4.63 N for 1.9 s. Notice the listed average thrust is 4.7 N, which is close to the value we would specify, but not exactly the same. Which is correct? That would depend on what you think is correct.\n3 3-D models"
