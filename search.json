    "text": "Aerotech Arreaux\n\nIt’s worth buying an extra-length motor-mount tubes to cert level 1. A length of at least 15” will work for Aerotech 29/180 or shorter motors. You’ll need to fiberglass your rocket to fly motors with more than 180 Ns of impulse. You will need a length of at least 16¼” for the H115DM-14A, the H182R-14A, the H135W-14A, and the H195NT-14A, and a length of at least 19¾” for the I205W-14A. For the extra-length motor mount tube, you can either order the replacement motor mount tube from Aerotech, or eRockets.\nYou won’t need the 24 mm motor adaptor and don’t need to construct it. Most of the parts are no longer in the kit.\nYou need to attach the included motor retainer instead of the Motor Hook, Thrust Ring, and Thrust Ring Flange. These changes are detailed in the Arreaux Motor Retainer Upgrade Notice. Attaching the motor retainer should be done AFTER the rest of the rocket construction is completed (after Step 1 of the FINAL ASSEMBLY AND FINISHING in the instructions), otherewise it will block the application of the cyannoacrylate to the fin roots and the aft Centering Ring. Use JB Weld to attach it. The details are in the Aerotech 29 mm Motor Retainer Instructions (all on the Aerotech website http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/resources.aspx?id=4 near the bottom of the page).\nUse tapped holes and threaded #6 nylon screws to secure the nosecone to the payload section. Two is the minimum, three is recommended, four is allowed. Friction fitting with tape isn’t sufficient.\nIt’s often useful to be able to replace either the body or the payload/nosecone. The recessed screw eye on the payload section makes it difficult. You may want to make an extension out of 1/8” rope and a quik-link and attache the shock cord to the quik-link.\nMake sure you can dry-fit the fins BEFORE you CA them in place. You may need to sand down the ridges a little to be able to snap the fins into place."

    "text": "LOC Precision Vulcanite\nThe build instructions for Labs 4 and 5 already incorporate most of the hints below. 1. Be sure to roughen all surfaces to be epoxied, with 60, 80, or 100 grit sandpaper before you glue so that the epoxy adheres better. 2. Get an Aero Pack RA 38mm L motor retainer. 3. Sand the bottom 3/8” of the motor mount tube until the motor retainer slides on easily. 4. Replace the elastic shock cord in the kit with 12 ft to 15 ft of either tubular/strap nylon or tubular/strap Kevlar, such as PML STRP-0.375, eRockets ER9044, Wildman KEVLAR1/4”, or Madcow SC_FLT_38_RED. 5. Use either the PML mounting style or the Modified PML mounting style for the shock cord. For the PML style, follow steps 1 & 2 in the Phobos Instructions. You’ll have to machine or file a notch in one of the centering rings to accomodate the shock cord. The centering ring on the other end (held in place with tape), must be at least 3/8” from the end of the motor mount tube and preferably 1/2” to accomodate the motor retainer. When assembled, the motor mount will protrude from the end of the rocket a bit. The modified PML style is similar, but instead of epoxying the shock cord axially to the motor mount, it is tied radially around the motor mount tube and included in the epoxy fillet between the motor mount tube and the centering ring. Step 2 of the Madcow Batray instructions show the tying technique, but has the notch on the outside of the centering ring instead of on the inside where it belongs. 6. If you want streamlined fins, round the leading edge, and taper the trailing edge. Leave the inside and outside edges square. 7. Consider laser-cutting a pair of fin guides to ensure the fins are perpendicular to the body tube. 8. Use the PML technique to attach the fins as shown in Step 4 of the Phobos Instructions. When you finally epoxy in the bottom centering ring, push it flush up against the fins. 9. When prepping the Payload Bay, consider finding a screw eye that attaches with a nut and washer rather than just a wood-screw end. 10. When you epoxy in the coupler tube bulkhead, recess it at least 1/8” so that you can put a decent fillet between the bulkhead and the coupler tube on the outside. DO NOT make the bulkhead flush with the end of the coupler tube. The LOC instructions say to, but they are seriously wrong and you may lose your payload section when the recovery charge goes off. 11. Secure the nose cone to the payload section with three countersunk #4 flat head screws. You can use the pan head screws but they don’t sit as flush. 12. If you are planning on Level 2 (J) flights, either replace or supplement the launch lugs with rail guides, either PML LRL-10-2 or Acme 54mm. 13. Secure the motor retainer with JB Weld."

The thinking is that once you are certified, you can experiment with more complicated configurations, but the first order of business is to get certified. However, if you are a person who pays attention to detail and are willing to ground test before flight, you can certify on a more complex, and more expensive rocket.\nIf you choose your rocket carefully, you can certify both Level 1 and Level 2 on the same rocket (and on the same day, but most senior people recommend against same-day multi-certs)."

    "text": "Level 1 motor recommendations\nYou can certify on either an H or an I motor, but you cannot take possession of the motor until just before your flight. You can have someone already Level 1 or above buy it for you and give it to you when you’re ready to prep for launch. Some on-line vendors are willing to sell you one motor for certification purposes, or you can buy it at the launch site when you’re ready to prep for launch if there is an on-site vendor. On the complete list of approved motors, the naming of the motors is framed as (Impuse Class) (Average Thrust) - (Time Delay)(Color) The most popular choices for Level 1 and Level 2 certification are the Aerotech single use motor, an Aerotech reload, or a CTI reload. Both the Aerotech and CTI reloads require you to have a motor case. Aerotech single-use motors are slightly more expensive than either brand of reload, but the CTI cases for the reloads are expensive, and the Aerotech cases for the reloads are even more expensive. Many rocketeers have cases you can borrow for the most common Aerotech sizes, and a case or two for CTI motors, so a reload with a borrowed case is the cheapest way to go. For a SLE rocket, the top two choices are the Aerotech H128W-14A reload and the CTI H163-14A reload, but for SLE you can use any H reload that fits in the Aerotech 29/180 case or any H reload that fits in the CTI 29mm 3-grain case. Many vendors have a qualification discount for your first HP motor for a qualifying flight."

    "text": "Level 1 rocket recommendations\nThere are lots of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 qualification flights. By no means consider the list below to be exhaustive.\n\nMadcow 1.6” Mini DX3\nComing in at about $70, this rocket will easily let you certify Level 1 (assuming you include a GPS Tracker) if you follow the linked construction techniques. In addition to the kit, you will need an Estes 29mm motor retainer and 5-minute epoxy. The perfect cert motor for this rocket is the Aerotech H128W. Recommended assembly instructions are found here.\n\n\nEstes Pro Series II\nThe least expensive way to certify Level 1 is to buy an Estes Pro Series II with a 29 mm motor mount (not 24 mm) for between $20 and $40 and make the modifications to fly it on an H motor. The Super Big Bertha is an upscale of a classic Estes rocket and may be worth considering. If you can’t get Pro Series II rocket for around $20-to-$40, you’re better off spending your money on the Madcow or one of the other rockets below.\nTo modify a Pro Series II for an H motor: * Leave out the engine block on the motor mount if the kit has one. * Put epoxy fillets on the fin joints. * Replace the shock cord with 10 to 15 feet of kevlar and attach it to the motor mount or through the wall, not just glued on. * Consider replacing the existing 1/4” launch lugs with heftier 1/4” launch lugs or rail guides.\nThese rockets do not feature very rugged construction and will survive a few flights, but don’t plan on doing much more than qualifying on it. Available from Estes, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nAerotech Arreaux\nThe Aerotech Arreaux is an excellent SLE rocket. However, to fly H motors, you’ll need to replace the stock 12” motor mount tube with a 15” or ~18” motor mount tube. See the construction hints below. Beyond the kit and the extra tube, all you need are CA adhesive and JB weld. We used modified Arreauxs in our classes for years. It’s much sturdier than the Estes Pro Series II, but not as sturdy as the Phobos, the Vulcanite, the Wildman Minis, or the Madcow thin-wall fiberglass. The rocket is available from Wildman, eRockets, Sirius, Apogee Components. The replacement motor mount tube is available from Aerotech, or eRockets.\n\n\nPML Phobos\nThe PML Phobos is an extremely rugged and reliable kit. If you pay attention to the instructions and are careful during construction it will last for years. You will want a motor retainer. You can certify Level 2 on it as well, but you’ll want to make certain of your construction techniques. Available from LOC Precision, eRockets.\n\n\nLOC Precision Vulcanite\nYou will build a Vulcanite as part of Labs 4 and 5. The Vulcanite is a fairly rugged rocket that can be used for both Level 1 and Level 2 flights. It’s not quite as rugged as the PML Phobos. You’ll want to order an Aero Pack Quick Change motor retainer. See building recommendations below if you want to try to cert Level 2 on it as well, or just want a very well constructed rocket. If you go for your Level 2 with it, you’ll want to use the Aerotech J270W-14A motor with 0.6g of BP. Available from LOC Precision, Wildman, eRockets, Sirius.\n\n\nWildman Mini\nAny of the Wildman Mini series rockets will work very well as a Level 1 qualifying rocket. They are extremely sturdy and will last for years. Be sure to get the quick-change retainer. The Nomex chute protector is also useful, but may only last a few flights. Consider the dual deploy upgrade if you don’t want an SLE rocket. Available from Wildman.\n\n\nMadcow\nMadcow has a number of rockets that will work for Level 1 and Level 2 flights. The previous E190 Class Rocket was a modified version of the Madcow Go Devil 38. However, the instructions are much less detailed and are designed for more experienced builders. Consult Prof. Spjut if you would like assistance with choosing a Madcow kit.\n\n\nApogee Components\nOne option to consider is the Apogee Peregrine. It is designed for dual deploy and will also work as a Level 2 rocket should you decide to use it. It has an amazing set of videos on construction if you need a little guidance. They also sell the Zephyr."

    "text": "High Power Rockets fall under code 1127 of the National Fire Protection Association. The text for Code 1127 can be found here\nTo meet the definition of a High Power Rocket under NFPA 1127, it must meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nUses a motor with at least 160 Newton-seconds of impulse\nUses a motor with at least 80 Newtons average thrust or a hybrid motor\nExceeds 125 grams of propellant\nWeighs at least 1,500 grams\nHas airframe parts made out of ductile metal.\n\nWhen starting your journey to amateur high-powered rocketry certification, safety must always be your top priority. High-powered rocketry is an exhiting and rewarding experience, but it comes with inherent risks that require careful consideration to established safety protocols. Understanding and implementing these measures is crucial not only for your well-being but also for the safety of all individuals attending the launch.\nWhether you are getting certified through NAR or TRAit is important to look through their guidelines prior to your first launch. The NAR Safety Code and the TRA Safety Code outline exactly what is expected for a safe launch that meets the qualifications for certification.\n\nGeneral Safety\nIt is strongly advised for all participants in high-powered rocketry to secure appropriate insurance through either NAR or TRA. These organizations offer liability coverage specifically designed for rocketry activities, providing peace of mind for both you and the launch site hosts.\nMake sure that all persons, builings, trees, or other possible obstructions are beyond the minimum required distance of the lauch site for the duration of the launch.\n\n\nSafety While Epoxying\nAlways use a lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses when using epoxy. Repeated contact of epoxy with skin leads to very serious allergic reactions.\nAdhesives need to be used in a fume hood, a spray-paint booth, or outdoors away from any air inlets to buildings. Ensure adequate ventilation when using epoxy.\nGlass microspheres are an inhalation hazard. Use extreme caution and use a face mask if possible.\nThe following steps make for good epoxy joints:\n\nSand every surface to be epoxied (including interior surfaces) with 80-to-110 grit sandpaper.\nClean the surface with a lint-free cloth or Swiffer.\nFor fiberglass, metals, or pastics, wipe the surface down with acetone or isopropyl alcohol and let dry before using the epoxy. Not necessary for cardboard, plywood, or paper\nProtect any exterior surface where you don’t want scratches or sanding marks with blue or masking tape before you begin sanding.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and lighter (with a small decrease in strength) by mixing in glass or silica microspheres. A 1:1 volume ratio of microspheres to epoxy usually works well. You could use 1:2 or 2:1 if you wanted. This mixture works well for fillets that don’t need to support large loads.\nYou can make the epoxy thicker and stiffer by mixing in chopped glass fibers. A 1:1 volume ratio of fibers to epoxy usually works well. If you want a smoother finish, use 1:2 or 1:3.\nEpoxy cures to a much higher strength if the joint is heated by a heat lamp or placed inside a heater while it cures. Do not let the joint heat above 140 °F (60 °C).\nIf you use spray paint, be sure that the location has proper ventilation.\nUse nitrile gloves, a face mask, and safety glasses when spray painting."

    "text": "A model is a set of equations or computer code that describes the flight of the rocket. The forces and torques in a rocket model come from gravity, thrust, lift, and drag. Models are classified as 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D models. A 1-D model assumes that the rocket flies straight up and falls under parachute straight down. A 2-D (or 3 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel vertically and horizontally, and rotate in the 2-D plane of motion. A 3-D (or 6 DoF) model assumes that the rocket can travel in 3-D space and rotate about any of its three principal axes. The required modeling in E178 is:\nDevelop or prove an analytic 1-D model with constant thrust during motor burning, and a constant coefficient of drag during the flight. Learn to use a 2-D (3 DoF) open source program called Open Rocket to model and predict rocket behavior. Use this code for all three rockets you will construct. Develop and/or use a 1-D code to permit calculation of 𝐶𝐷 and thrust curves from flight data."

This model assumes that the motor thrust is constant at the average level for the motor burn time. For example looking up the Estes C6 motor on ThrustCurve.org shows a total impulse of 8.8 Ns and a total burn time of 1.9 s. The motor would be modeled as generating a constant thrust of 8.8 Ns/1.9 s = 4.63 N for 1.9 s. Notice the listed average thrust is 4.7 N, which is close to the value we would specify, but not exactly the same. Which is correct? That would depend on what you think is correct.\n3 3-D models"
